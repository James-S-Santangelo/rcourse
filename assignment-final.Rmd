The final assignment is straightforward, but challenging. As a
team, you will work together to compile your findings into a scientific report. 
Imagine you are scientists writing a paper to publish your results in a
peer-reviewed journal.

Your report should have at least these sections: 

- "Background and Rationale"
- "Research Objectives and Hypotheses" 
- "Methods" (with "Data Description" and "Data Analysis" subsections)
- "Results"
- "Discussion"
- "Conclusion"

For the report, you are expected to:

- Search the previous research and literature on your research questions (*note*:
for this report, this is not terribly important and it will be worth very little
marks. Don't waste much time on this. We use this more so it helps you with your
analysis).
- Have clear and explicit objectives and hypotheses.
- Adequately describe and properly cite the data source you will analyze.
- Describe your data analysis in sufficient detail for others to understand what
you did and why.
- Show all the results of your pre-planned data analysis and any additional 
explorations you did.
- Discuss the meaning of your results and how they fit with the previous
literature.

The report and associated code is expected to:

- Be entirely reproducible.
- Have well documented code.

You are also expected to:

- Work well as a team.
- Use Git and GitHub to show your work and workflow with your team.

As a *guideline*, aim for at least 2500 words and about 6-8 figures/tables.
*This is **not** a hard criteria*. We are flexible in these *guidelines*, since
we want you to learn to work as a team and create a scientific product. You'll
be surprised how quickly the words, figures, and tables start adding up.

## Grading rubric

|                                                | Inadequate (0 marks)                                                                                                                                                                                          | Adequate (4 marks)                                                                                                                                                | Excellent (8 marks)                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Contribution to group work and self-assessment | Student contributed little to project; self-assessed contributions are low in quality and/or quantity; self-assessment is not consistent with actual contribution.                                            | Student contributed adequately to project; made some significant contributions                                                                                    | Student substantially contributed to project to ensure success; self-assessed contributions are crucial to project; self-assessment is consistent with actual contribution.            |
| Weekly progress (measured in GitHub commits)   | Several weeks in which no contributions are made to project                                                                                                                                                   | Adequate progress on project is made in most weeks                                                                                                                | Significant progress is made every week                                                                                                                                                |
| Content                                        | Missing crucial information; methods and results are inconsistent, not logical, or not adequately explained; conclusions are confusing or unsupported by results; unnecessary information included as clutter | Most essential information included; methods and results are adequately described; conclusions supported by results; most included material is relevant to report | All essential information included; methods and results are succinct, clear, logical, and scientifically valid; conclusions are creative and meaningful; project is concise throughout |
| Style and reproducibility                      | Code and writing are poorly organized, poorly formatted, missing units, difficult to read, poorly documented, difficult to reproduce analyses                                                                 | Code and writing are well-organized, well-formatted, consistent use of units and significant figures                                                              | Code and writing are precise and clear throughout, free of errors, well-organized, well-documented, easily reproducible analyses, publication-ready                                    |

As the final project is a team effort, all members within a group will receive the same mark. A final project that is considered to lie between two of the defined levels will be marked accordingly, e.g. between "Adequate" and "Excellent" would be 5, 6, or 7 marks.
