The final assignment is fairly straightforward, but also challenging. You, as a
team, must write up a scientific report/manuscript. The best way to think about 
this assignment is to imagine you are a scientist and you are writing a paper
to publish your research. This is essentially what we expect of you from the
final report.

So, your report should have at least these sections: "Background and Rationale",
"Research Objectives and Hypotheses", "Methods" (with "Data Description" and
"Data Analysis" subsections), "Results", "Discussion", and "Final Conclusion".

For the report, you are expected to:

- Search the previous research and literature on your research questions (this
doesn't have to be extensive).
- Have clear and explicit objectives and hypotheses.
- Adequately describe and properly cite the data source you will analyze.
- Describe your data analysis in sufficient detail for others to understand what
you did and why.
- Show all the results of your pre-planned data analysis and any additional 
explorations you did.
- Discuss the meaning of your results and how they fit with the previous
literature.

The report and associated code is expected to:

- Be entirely reproducible.
- Have well documented code.

You are also expected to:

- Work well as a team.
- Use Git and GitHub to show your work and workflow with your team.
