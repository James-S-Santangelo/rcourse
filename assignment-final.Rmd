The final assignment is straightforward, but challenging. As a
team, you will work together to compile your findings into a scientific report. 
Imagine you are scientists writing a paper to publish your results in a
peer-reviewed journal.

Your report should have at least these sections: 

- "Background and Rationale"
- "Research Objectives and Hypotheses" 
- "Methods" (with "Data Description" and "Data Analysis" subsections)
- "Results"
- "Discussion"
- "Final Conclusion".

For the report, you are expected to:

- Search the previous research and literature on your research questions (*note*:
for this report, this is not terribly important and it will be worth very little
marks. Don't waste much time on this. We use this more so it helps you with your
analysis).
- Have clear and explicit objectives and hypotheses.
- Adequately describe and properly cite the data source you will analyze.
- Describe your data analysis in sufficient detail for others to understand what
you did and why.
- Show all the results of your pre-planned data analysis and any additional 
explorations you did.
- Discuss the meaning of your results and how they fit with the previous
literature.

The report and associated code is expected to:

- Be entirely reproducible.
- Have well documented code.

You are also expected to:

- Work well as a team.
- Use Git and GitHub to show your work and workflow with your team.
