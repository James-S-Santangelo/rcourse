2 hours:

Rough outline:

- Datasets available for use
- Scientific method
- Example of an analysis plan
    - cover more on this next class
- Get into groups, the basics
    - exercise: write up initial skill set of each team member (keep is very simple for right now. only one or two skills)
        - roles: who will submit assignment, how will leadership/faciliator roles be rotated? who will be responsible for what?
- Identify 
    

Brainstorm:

- focus down on a few datasets everyone has to use (using survey results; sent out from previous week? Or from main survey from intro)

- scientific method (https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology)
    - ask them first
    - method:
        - identify research question
        - look into what the previous literature shows (how much emphasis on this?)
        - create a hypothesis or several hypotheses
        - write up an expected approach to answering that question (analysis plan; presentation plan)
            - how you will get the data and what data it is (the source)
            - what statistical or mathematical techniques have previous researchers used to address the question/hypotheses? (are they appropriate? optional since they may not have expertise)
            - what are some ways to present your data and results?
            - identify some possible tables and figures that will show off the results
        - run all analyses (or additional ones you may have id'd after trying out prev ones)
        - visualize or present all analyses
        - interpret all results 
        - draw conclusions based on hypotheses and question
        - publish your results (blogs, etc.)
        
- groups form now
    - Should the groups be random? Different skill levels 
    - Brief discussion about group dynamics, project management, sharing and being explicit about roles in the group
    - exercise: write up initial skill set of each team member (keep is very simple for right now. only one or two skills)
        - roles: who will submit assignment, how will leadership/faciliator roles be rotated? who will be responsible for what? Doesn't have to be completely decided right now, just so team members have an idea of their place in the team and how they can contribute
    - Discuss code of conduct
    
Introduce data sets, divide intro groups, think about interesting questions to ask, formulate hypothesis/plan of action.
+    - Potentially do this already the week before and have them take a survey with the data they want to work on and their background experience.
    - Quizzes on portal. Create a github account after the first class this week. Maybe write a data README?
+

Assignment (distribute who takes what item in your group to complete):
    - create a codeOfConduct.md file in RStudio. Write down what your team has decided.
    - create a team-description.md in RStudio. Write out what your team decided
    on the skills everyone has, how responsibilities will be assigned/taken, and
    how team roles will be rotated.
    - create a project-description.md file. Write out everything your team
    decided for which datasets and possible research questions.
    - As a group, list the datasets and research questions in order of priority
    for which ones you all want your final assignment to be on.

## Datasets for use

{{list/link them here}}

## Scientific method

- What is the scientific method?

### Steps in the scientific process

1. Identify research question(s).
2. Look into what the previous literature shows. <!--(how much emphasis on this?)-->
3. Create one or more hypotheses or objectives for the research.
4. Write up an outline or expected approach to answering those questions/objectives (analysis plan; presentation plan):
    - How will the data be obtained and what is the data (i.e. the source).
    - What statistical or mathematical techniques have previous researchers used? Will they be used or will other ones be used? Are they appropriate (optional, may need an expert)? 
    - How will the results/data be presented?
    - Identify/describe some possible tables and figures to present the results/data.
5. Run all analyses (or additional ones that may come up as you work with and analyze the data).
6. Visualize or present all results from analyses.
7. Interpret the results and how they fit in the context of the previous literature and findings.
8. Draw conclusions based on the hypotheses/objectives.
9. Publish your results (in blogs, pre-print archives, general archiving servers, journals, or at conferences)

## Team dynamics

- Everyone is different, every team is different. Communication is vital in order to achieve the team goal and to work together.
- 

### Identifying roles and responsibilities

- Facilitator's duty:
    - Goal is to keep things running smoothly, focused on the task, and on track for time
    - Keep everyone on topic and on task; stay aware of the time
    - (Try to) mediate or resolve any conflicts (there will *always* be some type of conflict; how it's dealt with is what matters)
    - (Try to) encourage everyone to participate. Try to allow everyone a chance at talking.
- Recorder's duty:
    - Goal is to write/type down main or important points raised or discussed when team is meeting
    - Keep notes and files organized and orderly
- Organizer's duty:
    - Arrange for next meeting time and location
    - Send reminders to members a day or two before meeting

### Code of conduct

How do you want each member to treat each other? This is the purpose of the code of conduct. While common sense usually ensures that 

## Group exercise

- Get into your {{assigned?}} groups
- Introduce each other:
    - Find out everyone's name and year of study
    - Find out what, if any, plans everyone has for next year
- Assign roles to each person (these roles will be rotated in every group setting):
    - Need: facilitator, recorder, organizer
    - Discuss how and when roles will be rotated (record it)
- Discuss and brainstorm some codes of conduct you want your team to follow (record it)
- Take a few minutes, think about your own skills and what you feel are most competent in
    - Then, share the top one or two of those skills (record those skills)
- Discuss how responsibilities of each member will be decided on (record it)

## Group project

In your group, rotate roles (need a facilitator and recorder). Before end of class:

- Choose two possible datasets your team would like to work from (can also be datasets not presented in class)
- Brainstorm as many research questions as possible for those two datasets. 
    - Goal is to write as much ideas down. No question is off limits and no question is too simple or too complex! Just write what ever comes to mind.

Make sure to record everything down!
