## Lesson preamble:

### Lesson objectives:

- **Main goal**: 
    - To start the process of identifying which dataset to use and some possible research questions
- **Secondary goals**:
    - Learn about the scientific method and *(the basics of)* how to apply it to your project
    - Learn basics of group dynamics in a team setting, how to share responsibilities and duties
    - Get into groups and start your projects

### Lesson outline:

Total lesson time: 2 hours

- Datasets available for use (10-20 min)
- What is the scientific method (20 min)
- Team dynamics and assigning roles and tasks (15-20 min)
- Break (10 min)
- Getting into groups (10 min)
    - Exercise (25-30 min)
    - Start project work (20-25 min)

## Scientific method

<!-- What is the scientific method? -->

### Simplified diagram of the scientific method

```{r fig_scientific_method, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz('
digraph rmarkdown {
    graph [layout = neato, splines = true]
    node [shape = box, style = rounded]
    Hypothesis [pos = "0.75,3.75!"]
    CollectData [label = "Collect Data", pos = "0.75,3!"]
    AnalyzeData [label = "Analyze Data", pos = "0.75,2.25!"]
    HypothesisTrue [label = "Hypothesis\nif TRUE", pos = "0,1.5!"]
    HypothesisFalse [label = "Hypothesis\nif FALSE", pos = "1.5,1.5!"]
    Report [label = "Report/Publish", pos = "0.75,0.75!"]

    Hypothesis -> CollectData -> AnalyzeData -> HypothesisTrue -> Report
    AnalyzeData -> HypothesisFalse -> {Report Hypothesis}
}')
```

### Steps in the scientific process[^sci_method]

1. Identify research question(s).
2. Look into what the previous literature shows. <!--(how much emphasis on this?)-->
3. Create one or more hypotheses or objectives.
4. Write up an outline or expected approach to answering those questions/objectives (analysis and presentation plan):
    - How will the data be obtained and what is the data (i.e. the source).
    - What statistical or mathematical techniques have previous researchers used? Will they be used or will other ones be used? Are they appropriate (optional, may need an expert)? 
    - How will the results/data be presented or visualized?
    - Identify/describe some possible tables and figures to present the results/data.
5. Run all analyses (or additional ones that may come up as you work with and analyze the data).
6. Visualize or present all results from the analyses.
7. Interpret the results and how they fit in the context of the previous literature and findings.
8. Draw conclusions based on the hypotheses/objectives.
9. Publish your results (in blogs, pre-print archives, general archiving servers, journals, or at conferences)

## Team dynamics

### Basics of succeeding with a team

Final assignment is in a group and to succeed, you need to understand team dynamics:

- Everyone is different, every team is different
- Communication is vital to work together and to achieve the goal
- Teams go through various stages
- Need consensus for group norms, goals, duties/responsibilities, and conduct/behaviour
    - Important that everyone has a stake in the project
- Rotate roles (specifically for the leader/facilitator)

### Stages of group formation

- "Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing-Adjourning Model"[^group_forming]
- Essentially, groups go through stages (not always all and not always in order):
    1. Getting to know one other
    2. Feeling comfortable and safer, testing boundaries
    3. Opening up, voicing opinions, potential for conflict
    4. Stronger bonds form, cooperative
    5. Greater focus and energy on completion of project
    6. Team ends after project is successfully completed
- These stages can be fast-tracked by discussing norms, duties, and conduct early on

[^group_forming]: See [Principles of Group Dynamics](https://open.lib.umn.edu/principlesmanagement/chapter/13-3-group-dynamics/) 

### Roles and responsibilities

- Leader/Facilitator's duty:
    - Goal is to keep things running smoothly, focused on the task, and on track for time
    - Keep everyone on topic and on task; stay aware of the time
    - (Try to) mediate or resolve any conflicts (there will *always* be some type of conflict; how it's dealt with is what matters)
    - (Try to) encourage everyone to participate and allow everyone a chance at talking
- Recorder's duty:
    - Goal is to write/type down main or important points raised or discussed when team is meeting
    - Keep notes and files organized and orderly
- Organizer's duty:
    - Arrange for next meeting time and location
    - Send reminders to members a day or two before meeting

### Code of conduct

- Vital to establishing boundaries and expectations of being a team member
    - How do you want each member to treat each other?
    - How do you deal with conflict?
    - What is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour?
- These are outlined in the code of conduct
- Mostly its common sense (be kind and respectful)
    - But its important that you as a team write out what everyone wants and agrees to

## Exercise

### As a group, complete these tasks

- Get into your assigned groups
- Introduce each other:
    - Find out everyone's name and year of study
    - Find out other things about each other (e.g. any plans for next year, etc)
- Assign roles to each person (these roles will be rotated in every group setting):
    - You need: facilitator, recorder, organizer
    - Discuss how and when roles will be rotated *(record it)*
- Discuss and brainstorm some codes of conduct you want your team to follow *(record it)*
- Take a few minutes, think about your own skills and what you feel are most competent in
    - Then, share the top one or two of those skills *(record those skills)*
- Discuss how responsibilities of each member will be decided on *(record it)*

## Starting the projects

### As a group, complete these tasks

In your group, rotate roles (need a facilitator and recorder at minimum). Before the end of class, finish these:

- Choose two possible datasets your team would like to work from (can also be datasets not presented in class) *(record them)*
- Brainstorm as many research questions as possible for those two datasets *(record them)*
    - Goal is to write as much ideas down
    - No question is off limits and no question is too simple or too complex! 
    - Just write what ever comes to mind

Make sure to *record* everything down! Many of these tasks will also be part of the assignment!
