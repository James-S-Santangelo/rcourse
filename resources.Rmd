## R Coding Style Guide

*All code submitted for grading* will need to conform to the coding style
guidelines as outline on [this Style Guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).
We will be discussing and highlighting how to automatically (or at least
consistently) use this style as we go through the lectures and labs. If you do
not follow these guidelines, you will be requested to make the necessary changes
and resubmit the assignment. The resubmission *still adheres* to the assignment
deadline and to the *late submission penalty (5% mark/day)*. So for example, if
we check that the coding style is not followed one day after the deadline and
you resubmit one day later, that is a *total of 10% penalty* on that assignment.
