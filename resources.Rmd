## R Coding Style Guide

*All code submitted for grading* for the final assignment will need to conform to the coding style
guidelines as outline on [this Style Guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).
We will be discussing and highlighting how to automatically (or at least
consistently) use this style as we go through the lectures and labs. For the
first few assignments, you will not be required to follow these guidelines,
however we will make a note in your assignment for you to fix it next time. In 
later assignments, part of the grade will come from adhering to the coding 
styles.
