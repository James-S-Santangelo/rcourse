## Recap and some tips

- You can include math in R notebooks using [LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics). 

    `$$\frac{dN}{dt} = r N (1 - N/K)$$` produces 
    $$\frac{dN}{dt} = r N (1 - N/K)$$

- **Differential equation**: an equation that describes how a function of
variables is related to derivatives of those variables.

- Drawing **phase portraits** in one dimension:

    ![Logistic equation simulation](https://github.com/UofTCoders/rcourse/raw/master/logistic.gif)

- Fixed points: values of $N$ at which `r eq_dn_dt`, the rate of change of $N$,
is $0$. To find fixed points, plot `r eq_dn_dt` vs. $N$ and find the place(s)
where it crosses the $x$ axis.
- Stability: if you start at some $N$ close to the fixed point but not exactly
on it, will you go towards (stable) or away (unstable) from the fixed point? The
sign of `r eq_dn_dt` on either side of a fixed point tells you whether $N$ will
increase or decrease in that area. Draw an arrow to the right if `r eq_dn_dt` is
positive, and draw and arrow to the left if `r eq_dn_dt` is negative.

#### Challenge

Find the fixed point(s) of the following differential equation.

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = \text{sin}(N)$$

   - Plot $\frac{dN}{dt}$ vs. $N$ for $N$ ranging from $0$ to $10$.
   - Sketch a phase portrait. Are the fixed point(s) stable or unstable?



```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

library(ggplot2)

N_seq <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)

dN_dt <- sin(N_seq)

qplot(N_seq, dN_dt) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0))
```

You can think of $dN/dt$ as a *velocity*: it tells you how fast $N$ is changing and in what
direction. If we start a **trajectory** at some initial $N_0$, $dN/dt$ dictates whether $N$ will
increase, decrease, or stay the same. If $N_0$ happens to be at a fixed point, $N$ will remain at
$N_0$ for all time. 

#### Challenge (time permitting)


Find the fixed point(s) of the following differential equation.

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 1$$

   - Plot $\frac{dx}{dt}$ vs. $x$ for $x$ ranging from $-2$ to $2$ in $0.1$ increments.
   - Sketch a phase portrait. Are the fixed point(s) stable or unstable?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

library(ggplot2)

x_seq <- seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1)

dx_dt <- x_seq^2 - 1

qplot(x_seq, dx_dt) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0))
```

## Numerically simulating models in R

Some differential equations are possible to solve analytically (by integration). 
But when we encounter equations that are hard to solve analytically, we can instead 
solve them **numerically**. Numerically solving a differential equation means calculating
an approximate solution for the variable of interest as it evolves in time, using the information
contained in the equation about the *rate of change* of the variable at each time point. 

Let's use the logistic equation as an example again. Like last class, we will plot $dN/dt$ vs. $N$.

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 

N_seq <-
  seq(-20, 100) # make a sequence of N values to plot dN/dt against
  
logistic_eqn <-  function(N, r, K) {
  # calculate dN/dt for the logistic equation
  
  # r: growth rate (divisions per hour) 
  # K: carrying capacity
  # N: population size
  return(r * N * (1 - N / K))
  }
  
dN_dt <- logistic_eqn(N_seq, r = 0.5, K = 80)
  
qplot(N_seq, dN_dt) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) # a line at zero for visual aid
```

$dN/dt$ is the **slope** of $N$ with respect to $t$ at a given value of $N$. 
We can use the slope as an update rule, exactly like the recursion equation we 
wrote last class that in the limit became a derivative:

$$lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{N_{t+\Delta t} - N_t}{\Delta t} = \frac{dN}{dt}$$ 

Given a starting point $N_t$, we can *approximate* $N_{t+\Delta t}$ using the differential equation:

$$\frac{N_{t+\Delta t} - N_t}{\Delta t} \approx \frac{dN}{dt} $$

$$N_{t+\Delta t} \approx N_t + \frac{dN}{dt} \Delta t$$

To generate a solution for $N$ as it varies with $t$, we loop through the recursion relation above,
updating $N$ at each timestep. 

The image below is a cartoon of what this looks like in practice. Starting from a point $A_0$, we use
the derivative to tell us in what direction we should take our next step. $\Delta t$ is a parameter
we can choose that determines how large of a step we take. 

This process has several names: **Euler's method** after Leonhard Euler who wrote about it 
in about 1770, or **forward finite difference method**, referring to the process of stepping 
forward in time in small (*finite*) increments (*difference*).

There are many related but slightly different techniques for numerically solving differential
equations. The best method will often depend on the situation, and we won't go into detail on any
other methods, but you can look up [*Runge-Kutta* methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)
if you're interested in learning more about it. 

R has a package for numerically solving differential equations called `deSolve`. 
We will be using this package as well as implementing Euler's method ourselves. 

### Euler's method on paper

We will calculate numerical solutions for the logistic equation so that we can compare what we know
about the fixed points and their stability with the way a population obeying this equation changes in
time. We'll start with a paper example, then later implement it in R with a loop.

This is the update rule: 

$$N_{t+\Delta t} = N_t + \frac{dN}{dt} \Delta t$$

To calculate a solution which consists of some values of $N$ at particular times $t$, we need to
choose a population size to start at ($N_0$), values for the parameters, and a timestep size ($\Delta t$). 

Let's choose $r = 1$, $K = 10$, $N_0 = 2$, and $\Delta t = 1$ to make our math easier.

Now we have $N_{t=0} = N_0 = 2$, and we want $N_{t=0+ \Delta t} = N_{t=0 +1} = N_1$. We apply the update rule:

$$N_1 = \frac{dN}{dt} \Delta t + N_0$$

$$N_1 = \frac{dN}{dt} \times 1 + N_0$$

$$N_1 = \frac{dN}{dt} + N_0$$
What should we put in for $dN/dt$? We know $dN/dt$ for the logistic equation is 

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

We've chosen $r$ and $K$, but what value should we put in for $N$? 

This is not obvious at all, and there's really no one right answer. There are other related methods
of numerically solving differential equations that choose a value of $N$ halfway between $N_0$ and
$N_1$ (the **midpoint method**), or you could use $N_1$. But the simplest thing to do is to use
$N_0$, because we don't yet know $N_1$ and it's slightly more complicated to use an $N$ that depends
on $N_1$. This is the process shown in the cartoon above --- we use the slope of $N$ at the point
$N_0$ to tell us where $N$ should be at the next timestep. 

If we put in $N_0$ to $dN/dt$:

$$N_1 = rN_0(1-\frac{N_0}{K}) + N_0$$

Now we have a thing we can calculate! Plugging in the numbers we chose for $r$, $K$, and $N_0$, we get

$$N_1 = 1 \times 2(1-\frac{2}{10}) + 2$$
$$N_1 =  2+ 1.6 = 3.6$$
We repeat the proccess to get $N_2$, and so on, remembering to evaluate $dN/dt$ at the value
of $N$ from the previous timestep. The vertical bar $\vert$ instructs us to substitute $N_0$
for $N$ in the derivative. 

$$N_2 = \frac{dN}{dt}\vert_{N = N_1} + N_1$$

$$N_2 = rN_1(1-\frac{N_1}{K}) + N_1$$

$$N_2 = 2.304 + 3.6 = 5.904$$

In 1770 there were no computers. It's really amazing that people were using these numerical
techniques long before computers existed to automate the process. According to Wikipedia, 
it was partly the push to develop faster and better ways to numerically solve differential 
equations that led to the computer as we know it. 

Lorenz simulated his famous equations on one of the earliest computers in 1960, and this was how he
discovered the chaotic behaviour of the model. 

In the movie *Hidden Figures*, Katherine Goble Johnson uses Euler's method to numerically match 
the equations for hyperbolic and elliptical orbit to get the astronaut John Glenn back from space.
Watch the scene [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-pbGAts_Fg). 

### Euler's method in R

Let's review `for loops` first. A loop is a method to do something over and over again, which is
perfect for Euler's method --- on paper, we were performing the same calculation over and over 
with a different value of $N$ each time. 

Here's an example from an earlier lecture:

```{r}
# For each number in v, print the number.
v <- c(2, 4, 6)
for (num in v) {
    print(num)
}
```

Now let's build up our Euler's method code in R. 

```{r}
# Numerically solve the logistic equation using Euler's method

# We have a function `logistic_eqn` that we defined before, so we can use that one.
# We don't need to re-write it here if the previous chunk has been executed, but we can.

logistic_eqn <-  function(N, r, K) {
  # calculate dN/dt for the logistic equation
  
  # r: growth rate (divisions per hour) 
  # K: carrying capacity
  # N: population size
  return(r * N * (1 - N / K))
  }

# parameters
K <- 150; r <- 1  # you can put things on the same line, separated by a semicolon

dt <- 0.05 #timestep - the smaller, the better
tmax <- 8 # the total time we want to numerically solve for
points <- tmax/dt # the number of data points in the simulation - add 1 so that we can start at t=0

# vectors to store values of N and t at each timestep:
N_vector <- numeric(points) # population size
t_vector <- seq(0, tmax - dt, by = dt) # time vector

# initial condition
N0 <- 10
N_vector[1] <- N0 

N <- N0 # initialize variable N

for (i in 2:points){ # start at 2 because the initial state is at position 1
  dN <- logistic_eqn(N = N, r = r, K = K)*dt
  N <- N + dN # the variable N is changing at each step of the loop
  N_vector[i] <- N
}

qplot(t_vector, N_vector,
      ylab = "Population size N",
      xlab = "Time t") 
```

This numerical solution shows us that the population size grows until it reaches the carrying capacity $K$, the stable fixed point. 

### A note on why $dt$ has to be small
  
If you're numerically solving a differential equation with Euler's method, $dt$ must be 'small'. 
How small is small, and why does it have to be small? The answers to these are related, and to see why,
let's look at what can happen if $dt$ is too big with an example from the logistic equation. 

```{r}
# what happens if we make dt too large when simulating? 
# in this example, the starting population N0 is much larger than the carrying capacity.
# This means dN/dt will be a large negative number: N will decrease quickly from such a large size.

r <- 0.5
K <- 50
dt <- 1
N0 <- 400

dN <- logistic_eqn(N0, r, K)*dt # this is the change in N that we wil add to N0 to calculate N1

N1 <- N0 + dN

print(N1) # this is no good: N has shot from +400 to -1000 in a single step! 

dN <- logistic_eqn(N1, r, K)*dt # calculate what the next change in N would be

N2 <- N1 + dN

print(N2) # N is getting more and more negative!
 
```

#### Challenge - in groups

Use Euler's method to calculate a numerical solution for the following differential equation:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = -2.3 x$$

  - Try a few different step sizes ($\Delta t$) such as $0.7$ and $1$. What happens if $\Delta t$ is too large?

This is what's called **numerical instability** --- the numerical solution grows very large 
(either positive or negative) but the true solution doesn't. In the logistic equation example above,
this numerical instability can happen if $N$ falls below $0$: the population will keep getting
more and more negative after that. 

## Using `deSolve` in R to solve differential equations numerically

R has a package called `deSolve` which contains several functions to numerically solve differential equations.
Let's look at the documentation for `deSolve`:

```{r}
library(deSolve)
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(deSolve)
```

This is pretty hard to read, especially if your calculus was a long time ago. The important thing to know for
our purposes is that the equations we're working with are **first-order ordinary differential equations**.
*First-order* means that the derivatives are all first derivatives (as opposed to second derivatives, third
derivatives, etc.). **Ordinary** means that the derivatives are full derivatives (as opposed to partial
derivatives which are written $\partial N / \partial t$). 

This means that the function we'll be using is called `ode`, which stands for 'ordinary differential equation'. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(ode)
# The possible methods are all different ways of numerically solving DEs.

#stiff vs. non-stiff : no precise definition, but 'stiff' generally means it's possible to be numerically unstable if the step size is too big. 
```

The method used by `ode` to numerically solve differential equations is called `lsoda`, which automatically
tries to use the best method depending on the equation. This is why people like to use functions like `ode`:
the result is often more accurate than Euler's method and might also be faster to run. 

```{r}
# Example: deSolve with logistic eqn

# now we need to define our function a bit differently to be in the format that `ode` uses
logistic_fn <- function(t,state,parameters) { 
  # Calculates dN/dt for the logistic equation
  
  # t: time point at which to evaluate derivative (doesn't actually change anything in this example)
  # state: vector of variables (here it's just N)
  # parameters: vector of parameters c(r, K)
  
  N <- state 
  
  r <- parameters[1] # the first element of the parameters vector is r
  K <- parameters[2] # the second element of the parameters vector is K

  #rate of change
  dN <- r*N*(1-N/K)
    
  #return rate of change
  list(c(dN))
}

parameters <- c(r = 0.5, K = 50)
state <- c(N = 10)
times <- seq(0, 50, by = 0.01)

#help(ode) # look at the documentation to learn about the parameters
result <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = logistic_fn, parms = parameters)
```

The output of `ode` is a vector that contains the times we requested and its calculated values of N. 

Notice that by using `ode` we didn't have to write a loop explicitly ourselves, and we didn't have to
choose a timestep. `ode` does under the hood a version of what we did explicitly before. 

```{r}
print(head(result, 5)) # result has a list of times and values of N at those times
print(class(result)) # result is a 'matrix': an array of numbers
```

```{r}

result <- data.frame(result) # convert it to a dataframe so we can use ggplot

ggplot(result) +
  geom_point(aes(x = time, y = N))
```

Now let's make a nice plot of numerical solutions from a few different starting points.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

parameters <- c(r = 0.5, K = 50)
initial_conditions <- seq(10, 80, by = 10)
times <- seq(0, 50, by = 0.01)

results <- list() # make an empty list
count <- 1

for (N0 in initial_conditions) {
  
  result <- ode(y = N0, times = times, func = logistic_fn, parms = parameters)
  result <- data.frame(result)
  
  results[[count]] <- result
  
  count <- count + 1
}

all_results <- bind_cols(results)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(all_results) # look at what we got

print(colnames(all_results)) # column names
```

```{r}
ggplot(all_results) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = X1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time1, y = X11)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time7, y = X17)) # etc, we can keep adding more here

```

## Qualitative analysis of 2D models

Now we'll move on to look at how to analyze two-dimensional models. **Two-dimensional** means that there are now two variables in the system (like $x$ and $y$, prey and predators) instead of one (like $N$).

Many of the concepts and tools from analyzing one-dimensional models will be used here as well, but we will add some things that are specific to more than one dimension. 

To motivate some of these new concepts and the idea of modelling in two dimensions, let's analyze a model of two species interacting.

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = cx - dy$$

This is sort of like the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, but the term for predator growth is $cx$ instead of $cxy$. In this model the predators will eat the prey at a constant rate, no matter how many of the predators there are. 

First, we'll simulate a trajectory for the two species.

```{r}
lotka_volterra <- function(t,y,parameters) { 
    
  
    # the arguments need to be named "t", "y", and "parameters", otherwise this won't work with phaseR
    
    X <- y[1] # now the state vector y has two elements because we have two species
    Y <- y[2] 
    
    a <- parameters[1]
    b <- parameters[2]
    c <- parameters[3]
    d <- parameters[4]
    
    print(X)
    print(Y)
    
    #rate of change
    dx <- a*X - b*Y*X
    dy <- c*X - d*Y
    
    #return rate of change
    list(c(dx, dy))
}

parameters = c(0.5, 1, 1, 0.2)

state <- c(X = 0.5, Y = 0.5) # these variables need to match the function arguments in label

times <- seq(0, 50, by = 0.01)

out <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = lotka_volterra, parms = parameters)
    
out <- data.frame(out)

ggplot(out) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = X), color = 'red') +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = Y), color = 'blue') 
```

It looks like we have oscillations that decay to a fixed point. To find out more generally what the fixed points are, we can plot 

 - fixed points
 - stability
 - phase portraits
 - introduce null clines - *cline* comes from a Greek word meaning "slope"
 - introduce isoclines? null cline is a special case of isocline






```{r}
lotka_volterra(2,y = c(0.6,0.5), parameters = c(0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8))
```


```{r}
# deSolve with lotka volterra

#parameters = c(alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.6, gamma = 0.5, delta = 0.5)

parameters = c(0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 0.5)

state <- c(X = 0.5,
 Y = 0.5) # these variables need to match the function arguments in label

times <- seq(0, 100, by = 0.01)

out <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = lotka_volterra, parms = parameters)

plot(out)
```


```{r}
library(phaseR)

LV_flowField <- flowField(lotka_volterra, x.lim = c(0,5), y.lim = c(-1,3),
                          parameters = c(alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.6, gamma = 0.5, delta = 0.5),
                          points = 21, system = 'two.dim',
                          add = FALSE)
                          
```


```{r}

library(phaseR)

xdot <- function(x,y,alpha) {
  return(x - alpha*y*x)
}

ydot <- function(x,y,beta,delta) {
  return(beta*y*x - delta*y)
}

deriv <- function(x,y,alpha,beta,delta) {
  return 
}


# Plot the flow field, nullclines and several trajectories for the one
# dimensional autonomous ODE system logistic.
logistic.flowField <- flowField(logistic, x.lim = c(0, 5), y.lim = c(-1, 3),
                                parameters = c(1, 2), points = 21, system = "one.dim",
                                add = FALSE)
logistic.nullclines <- nullclines(logistic, x.lim = c(0, 5), y.lim = c(-1, 3),
                                  parameters = c(1, 2), system = "one.dim")
logistic.trajectory <- trajectory(logistic, y0 = c(-0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5), t.end = 5,
                                  parameters = c(1, 2), system = "one.dim")
