# Introduction


## What is a model? Why do we model? 


Up until this point in this course, we've been working with statistical models
with the goal of characterizing relationships between variables and their
significance in existing data. Today, we are going to venture into another
branch of applied mathematics and learn about _mathematical models_. A
mathematical model (a.k.a. first-principle models) is a description of a system
using a series of equations. These models are used extensively throughout the
natural and social sciences to help explain and predict the behavior of various
systems of interest. 

The world is governed by series of natural laws and "truths" biologists refer
to as first principles. For instance, ocean currents flow in a certain
direction, and some salmon species reproduce just once in their life time.
Mathematical models provide us with an opportunity to study the intricacies of
biological systems under a framework of first principles. More accurately,
models forces us to explicitly lay out our conception of "reality" and to
confront those intuitions. Intuition is perhaps the biggest pitfall in biology
-- everybody loves to tell a good story where everything works out and
everything makes perfect sense, but how rigorously have we actually weeded them
before accepting story as dogma? When you construct a model, you have no choice
but to verify every single last piece of information you plan to include in
your model. 

Technically, one can describe any biological phenonemon with math. At the same
time, however, it is rarely the goal to rewrite "reality" in math. The most
elegant models are those able to describe succinctly a system's most essential
attributes, and the best theoreticians are those with the state-of-the-art
knowledge of the system and the clarity of mind to know exactly what those
important features are _given the questions being asked_. Sometimes we ask
grand questions about driviers of macro system change, other times we would
kill to find that devil in the details. Knowing how best to represent your
system and answer your question is a skill that comes with experience (read:
lots of trials and lots and _lots_ of errors).

What models are good for: 

* Guiding intuition regarding how processes and mechanisms work.
* Pointing out logical flaws in an argument when the math don't make sense.
* Testing hypotheses that are otherwise untestable due to ethical concerns
  and/or logistical constraints.
* Generating new testable hypotheses and predictions and can inform
  experimental design.
* Provide a new framework on how to think about a problem.

Limitations of a model:

* Only as interesting as the motivating question.
* Only as robust as the theory that went into building it.
* All models are wrong, some are useful.
* Without data, models are only good for telling us what is possible, but not
  what happened or what will happen.

Diversity promotes science and progress. Thus, any good researcher should
strive to have at least a basic understanding of both the empirical and
theoretical sides of science in order to facilitate collaboration and
synthesis, and to push the frontiers of knowledge.


## Setup

Here are the packages we will be using today:


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(deSolve)

```


# Getting started with theory 


## Some simple terminologies


* Variable -- quantity changes over time, a.k.a. the things we are tracking.
* Parameter -- pre-determined values, quantity doesn't change over time, a.k.a.
  the things we know or think that we know.
* Dynamics -- fancy way of saying patterns of change over time.
* Equilibria -- the state at which the system stops changing.
* Stability -- whether the system will remain at a particular state when
  perturbed.
* Sensitivity -- how readily a system will change when perturbed.


## Some simple classifications


Two basic categories based on how to solve: analytic and numeric 

* A model is solved analytically when exact solutions of desired outputs are
  obtained. 
* Numeric methods allows you to approximate solutions when the system is too
  complex to solve.

Two basic categories based on type of dynamics: discrete and continuous

* Discrete time models describe change in discrete time step with recursion
  equations. These are useful when modelling semelparous organisms.
* Continous time models allow variables to change at any point in time, and is
  described with differential equations. These are useful when modelling
iteroparous organisms.

Two basic categories based on nature of change: deterministic and stochastic 

* Deterministic models assumes the future is determined entirely by model
  mechanics. 
* Stochastic models assumes that there are random events that affect the
  biological processes of interest. There is always some element of randomness
in real life. Whether to model that randomness explicitly depends on how big of
a role it plays in determining the dynamics of your system.


## Learning basic model mechanics through classic models in EEB


In this section, we will learn different ways to represent system change from
one time step to another by examining and deriving some classic models in EEB. 


### Exponential growth

The first population model we examine is the exponential growth model, which
describes a population that grows without restriction, e.g., bacteria on a
petri dish.

* In discrete time: literally what is $N_{t+1}$ given $N_t$.

$$N_{t+1} = RN_t$$

* In continous time: population growth is described as change in $N$ per change
  in $t$. $dN/dt$ is thus the rate of population change, or the _growth rate_
of a population. 

$$\frac{dN}{dt}=rN$$

Note that $R$ and $r$ are **not** the same. $R$ is termed the _reproductive
factor_ (or ratio, or number), and it represents the number of replicates each
individual makes of themselves in a subsequent time step. On the other hand,
$r$ describes the per capita change in number of individual from one generation
to the next and is referred to as the _intrinsic growth rate_. 

If we want to find out what the population size is at $t=t+1$, we simply plug
the necessary parameters into the recursion equation listed like this:

```{r} 

# Set up some master controls such that it is easier to customize model later on

N0 = 10 # Initial population size
R = 1.2 # Reproductive factor

N1 = R*N0; N1 

```


Most of the time though, biologists want to track the population for more than
just one time step. In that case, we could continue to do math like this

$$N_{t+5} = R(R(R(R(RN_0))))$$

which simplifies to 

$$N_{t+5} = R^5 (N_0)$$

and then further simplifies to

$$N_{t+n} = R^n(N_0)$$

We coould also take a graphical approach and draw out the dynamics of the
system for 50 time steps.


```{r}

N0 <- 10 # Initial population size
R <- 1.2 # Reproductive factor
times <- 50 # Number of time steps

N <- c() # Make empty vector to store population size at each time step
N[1] <- N0 # Initiate vector

# Make for loop to iterate through the model 50 times
# Running (times-1) iterations gets us to generation N[i+1]

for (i in 1:(times-1)) { 
  N[i+1] = R*N[i]
  }

# Plot the newly loaded N vector 

plot(seq(1, times, 1), N, xlab="time")

```


As expected, this population is literally spinning out of control! In reality,
however, even bacteria on a petri dish can't grow forever. What are some
factors that may limit population growth?


### Logistic growth

Organisms often find themselves limited by resource availability as their
numbers grow. This causes their per capita growth rate to decreases as the
population increases towards the resource limit known as the _carrying
capacity_, $K$.

* In discrete time: 

$$N_{t+1} = N_t+r(\frac{K-N_t}{K})N_t$$

* In continous time: 

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = r(\frac{K-N}{K})N$$

When interpreted in plain English, the growth rate of the population is being
discounted depending on how close to $K$ it is. When the population is very
small, $\frac{K-N}{K} \approx 1$ and logistic growth approximates exponential
growth. When the population is close to $K$, $\frac{K-N}{K} \approx 0$ and thus
the population size stops increasing. 

We can examine the logistics growth model graphically just like we did before.


```{r}

N0 <- 10 # Initial population size
r <- 0.5 # Intrinsic growth rate
K <- 1000 # Carrying capacity
times <- 50 # Number of time steps

N <- c() # Make empty vector to store population size at each time step
N[1] <- N0 # Initiate vector

for (i in 1:(times-1)) { 
  N[i+1] = N[i]+r*N[i]*(1-(N[i]/K))
  }

plot(seq(1, times, 1), N, xlab="time")

```


Initially ($t=0$ to $t=10$), the population grows rapidly, and the form of the
growth model resembles the exponential growth model. As the population
increases ($t=10$ to $t=20$), the growth rate slows, and eventually plateaus at
the carrying capacity $K=1000$. 


### When species are in competition -- the Lotka-Volterra model

This example will show case how to model two interacting populations,
specifically, populations in competition for a limiting resource. Focusing on a
continous time example, we will first write down the logistic growth models of
two populations (differentiated by subscripts), and then add in the effect of
their interaction.

$$\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r(\frac{K-N_1}{K})N_1$$
$$\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r(\frac{K-N_2}{K})N_2$$

What does competition do to organisms? Well, many things, but in terms of
population dynamics, competition hinders the growth of a population, and the
degree of reduction in growth is governed by the _competition coefficient_,
$\alpha_{ij}$. The subscripts $i$ and $j$ correspond to our two populations,
and the order of the subscript tells us who is affecting whom. For example,
$\alpha_{ij}$ represents the effect of $j$ on $i$, whereas $\alpha_{ji}$
represent the effect of $i$ on $j$.

Adding these terms into the population growth equations gives the classic
Lotka-Volterra model for competition: population growth is governed jointly by
how close it is to carrying capacity, but also the effect of the competing
species has on it (per capita strength of effect $\times$ number of individuals
around to exert this effect).

$$\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r(\frac{K- N_1 - \alpha_{12} N_2}{K})N_1$$
$$\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r(\frac{K - N_2 - \alpha_{21} N_1}{K})N_2$$


### Models of evolution 

In line with the most basic definition of evolution, evolution models describes
change in allele frequency in a population over time. These models are
sometimes referred to as population genetics (pop gen) models. We will work
with a one-locus haploid model in this example.

Consider a population of individuals each carrying one of two variants of a
certain gene; let's call them alleles _A_ and _a_ because we are creative like
that. Similar to ecologists, evolutionary biologists are often interested in
the reproductive factor (or survivability, denoted $W$) of individuals with
different genotypes. The dynamics of these two sub-populations can be expressed
as

$$N_{A, t+1} = W_A N_{A, t}$$

$$N_{a, t+1} = W_a N_{a, t}$$

Typically, evolutionary biologists are concerned with the _proportion_ of a
certain allele in a population rather than changes to their absolute numbers.
Here, we will use $p$ and $q$ to denote the proportions of the _A_ and _a_
alleles in the population, respectively. 

$$p_{t}=\frac{N_{A,t}}{N_{A,t}+ N_{a,t}}$$

$$q_{t}=1-p_{t}$$

Doing so also allow us to leverage the fact that the proportions $p$ and $q$
must add up to 1, and therefore the dynamics of the allele frequencies in a
population can be described with just one equation:

$$p_{t+1}=\frac{W_A N_{A,t}}{W_A N_{A,t}+W_a N_{a,t}}$$

In order to write an equation that tracks change in allele frequency over time,
as promised, we need to transform $N$ (the number of each type) to $p$
(proportion). Through the magic of algebra, we have

$$p_{t+1}=\frac{W_A p_t}{W_A p_t+W_a q_t}$$

Note that $N_A$ is **not** interchangeable with $p$; the algebra just happened
to work out this way.

Lastly, remember our good friend $p+q=1$? 

$$p_{t+1}=\frac{W_A p_t}{W_A p_t+W_a (1-p_t)}$$


## How to construct a model


### Step 0: Breathe

Don't panic, and try not to be overwhelmed. Trust us when we say it is not as
daunting as it appears. This doesn't mean that it is easy to write a model
either, but there are lots of resources available to help you achieve your
ambition. The biggest hurdle is often to simply _start_. Know that whatever you
do, these are just numbers and symbols and words on paper and on the screen,
you can't break anything or hurt anything (except maybe R, but just turn it on
and off again and all will be forgiven, life will move on). So don't be afraid
to start typing and playing around with ideas. Know also that you will be
making mistakes and will have to troubleshoot your way through a theory project
(any project really...). We all go through that, even the most experienced
theoreticians make mistakes. Experience comes with time and practice, and you
will learn how to quickly spot mistakes, and how to effectively troubleshoot.
None of that will happen though, if you don't start.

So let's start!

### Step 1: Formulate the question.

* What do you want to know? Start with the simplest, biologically-reasonable
  description of the problem. 
* Having clear objectives is crucial!

### Step 2: Determine the basic ingredients of the model.

* Decide on which type of model to use (discrete vs. continous time, stochastic
  vs. deterministic, etc.).
* Define the variables and parameters you want to keep track of.
* **Think about the assumptions you are making about your system**. Given that
  we can't ever full replicate reality (and we don't want to anyway), we are
neccessarily making simplifying assumptions about our system as we write our
model. What are those assumptions? You need to make them clear to both yourself
and your audience. Your model can only be interpreted in the context of these
assumptions. 

### Step 3: Qualitatively describe the system.

* Use life-cycle diagrams and flow charts to decribe changes to the
  individuals/populations/communities that you're modelling.
* Make a table or list of variables and how they will interact with each other.
* Think about the possible outcomes and types of output you want from your
  model.

### Step 4: Quantitatively describe the system.

* Using the diagrams and tables etc as guides, draft out equations that
  describe your system.
* Think about the functional forms of interactions in your model and how to
  parameterize your model (i.e., where are you going to get data?).
* Perform checks to make sure the structure of the model is logically sound
  (e.g., will your model return negative population size?).

### Step 5: Analyze your model

* There are abundant options regarding how to analyze a model. These range from
  finding equiliria and performing a stability analysis analytically, to
numerically simulating population dynamics over time.
* Choose the appropriate analysis for your system and question, and make sure
  that the output does address the question adequately! 

### Step 6: Checks and balances 

* Check results against data or known cases.
* Consider alternatives to a simplified model -- how can this model be
  extended?

### Step 7: Relate results back to the question

* Interpret the results and describe any new insights obtained in the context
  of assumptions made.
* How general are your results? Are the results counterintuitive? Why?

We will be following this recipe (roughly) in our build-a-model workshops. 


# Build-a-model workshop 1 -- Modelling malaria transmission dynamics 


First, take a _deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep_ breath.

In this workshop, we are going all the way back to the dawn of mathematical
models in biology. We will borrow from the classic malaria model orginally
developed by Ross (1908), and later solidified by Macdonald (1956), which
investigates the required efficacy of mosquito management programs in order to
eradicate malaria. 

_Note:_ It is actually very common practice to adapt old models to answer new
questions. In fact, practically _all_ of the malaria models that exist today is
a variation of the Ross-Macdonald model. 

The Ross-Macdonald model is a continuous-time, deterministic, model which
tracks the number of **S**usceptible, **I**nfected, and **R**ecovered subjects
over the course of a malaria outbreak. These models are sometimes referred to
as _SIR_ models, and they have been adapted to model numerous diseases beyond
malaria.

Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the malaria transmission cycle we will be modelling today.

![Flow diagram illustrating a basic epidemiological model of malaria transmission. The blocks represent different host and vector classes within a population. Arrows describe possible movements between host/vector categories. Subscripts _h_ and _m_ represent hosts and mosquitoes, respectively.](image/model.png)

The principle epidemiological compartments (i.e., variables) of interest are
the populations of infectious hosts ($I_h$) and infectious vectors ($I_m$).
These compartments are interdependent via the hostsâ and the vectorsâ rate of
exposure to the parasite, given by $\beta I_m$ and $\beta I_h$, respectively,
where $\beta$ represent the per capita biting rate of vectors. Upon contact,
susceptible hosts ($S_h$) and mosquitoes ($S_m$) become infected with
probabilities $\varphi_h$ and $\varphi_m$, respectively. For simplicity, we
will assume that hosts cannot acquire immunity and so the "recovered" class was
not included in this model. Instead, hosts either die of infection at rate
$\alpha$ or recover and return to $S$ class at rate $\gamma$. Vectors were
assumed to be immediately infectious upon successful infection, are unaffected
by the parasites they carry, and remain infected for life (i.e., no $\alpha$
and $\gamma$ for vectors). All host and vector die of natural causes at rate
$\mu_h$ and $\mu_m$, respectively. The host and vector populations were assumed
to be closed and constant over time such that all deaths are immediately
replaced by immigration of individuals into susceptible classes, represented by
the symbol $\tau$.  

After all that prefacing, we're finally ready to do math! 

Recall that, in contrast to recursion equations where we describe directly the
change in the value of a variable, an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
model describes _how_ the population is changing. We will follow this simple
formula when we translate our flow diagram to our equations:

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rate\;of\;increase - rate\;of\;decrease$$

Or, 

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = flow\;rates\;along\;arrows\;entering\;a\;compartment - flow\;rates\;along\;arrows\;exiting\;a\;compartment$$

Note that the order of the entering and exiting of compartments is irrelevant
because each time step is so small, it doesn't matter which event happens first
within that time step. 

The resulting model is thus made up of a system of four ODEs, two for hosts and two for vectors, written as follows:

$$\frac{dS_h}{dt} = \tau_t - (\mu_h +\beta \varphi_h I_m)S_h + \gamma I_h$$

$$\frac{dI_h}{dt} = (\beta \varphi_h I_m)S_h - (\gamma + \mu_h + \alpha_h) I_h$$

$$\frac{dS_m}{dt} = \tau_m - (\mu_m + \beta \varphi_m I_h)S_m$$

$$\frac{dI_m}{dt} = (\beta \varphi_m  I_h)S_m - \mu_m I_m$$

The trickiest part of writing these equations is probably to remember that the
rate at which susceptible hosts ($S_h$) become infected ($I_h$) will depend on
how many infected mosquitoes ($I_m$) are around to deliver those infection
($\beta$ is the **per capita** biting rate, which means the number of times
**each** mosquito will bite a host). The same logic applies to the process in
which mosquitoes become infected (going from $S_m$ to $I_m$).

Now that we have our model written out, it is R's turn to do some math for us.
Specifically, R will _solve_ this system for us and save us from a lot of
headache and paper. To solve a system of ODEs means we will integrate the
equations (i.e., turn $\frac{dN}{dt}$ into $N$) to find expressions that
describes the state of each population as a function of the remaining variables
and parameters.

We will code our model like we did before, this time with roughly 100$\times$
the parameters, variables, and equations. First, we will set up a bunch of
master controls for easy model manipulation later on. Then, we will write out
our ODE model as a function that our solver will deal with. Lastly, we will
call the ODE solver _lsoda_ to put all this together. 

### Define required parameters for the main program

1. Time vector:


```{r}

times <- 50; # Time is per day               
timevec <- seq(0, times, 1) 

```


2. Assign values for model parameters:
  
  - These parameter values are mostly informed guesstimates. The reason we're
    not using "real" parameter values here is because the model is too simple a
representation of "real life", and real numbers don't make sense in this
horrible rendition of reality. For instance, mosquitoes _infected_ with the
parasite don't actually become _infectious_ right away. There is a 10-14 day
incubation period where mosquitoes do nothing but sit around and accumulate
mortality before they can transmit malaria. Since we do not account for this
incubation period in our model, using the "real" daily mortality rate of
mosquito results in a drastic underestimation of their true mortality risk, and
an over-abundance of mosquitoes in our hypothetical population.  
  - Since the per capita biting rate ($\beta$) changes with population size, we
    decomposed ($\beta$) into its components (i.e., number of bites per
mosquito per day and population size) for easy calculation. In this example,
$\beta$ is actually constant through out because we assumed closed and constant
population size ($N$), but setting up the variable in this manner will allow
for flexibility if one day we wish to relax that assumption. 
  - Make sure that the $N$ here is the same as the population size we will
    assign later!


```{r}

# Units are assumed to be /day

mu.h <- 0.05; mu.m <- 0.1 # Natural mortality
psi.h <- 0.1; psi.m <- 0.1 # Probability of infection upon exposure
b <- 0.25 # number of times a mosquito bites per day
N <- 500 # Total population size (remains constant)
beta <- b/N # Number of times a mossie bite each person in a day
gamma <- 0.03 # Recovery rate (host only)
alpha <- 0.2 # Disease mortality rate (host only)

# String it all up as a vector

parms <- c(mu.h, mu.m, psi.h, psi.m, b, N, beta, gamma, alpha)

```


3. Give the model something to get it going a.k.a. assign initial conditions:


```{r}

s.h0 <- 450; i.h0 <- 50 # Host - make sure this is the same N as above
s.m0 <- 200; i.m0 <- 50 # Vector

# Make into another vector

Y0 <- c(s.h0, i.h0, s.m0, i.m0)

```


4. Define the function that specifies the ODE model called by _lsoda_ a.k.a. type out equations.


```{r}

odeequations <- function(t, y, parms) 
{
  # Retype parms and initial conditions
  # This will link parameters set "outside" of the function to the equations "inside"

  # Natural mortality parms
  mu.h <- parms[1]; mu.m <- parms[2]
  
  # Probability of infection parms
  psi.h <- parms[3]; psi.m <- parms[4] 
  
  # Biting rate parms
  b <- parms[5]; N <- parms[6]; beta <- parms[7]
  
  #recovery parms
  gamma <- parms[8];
  
  #virulence 
  alpha <- parms[9];
  
  # Initial conditions
  s.h <- y[1]; i.h <- y[2]; s.m <- y[3]; i.m <- y[4]
  
  # These are the differential equations 
  # These should be written in the same order as the initial conditions
  dsh = (mu.h*s.h + (mu.h + alpha)*i.h) - (mu.h + beta*i.m*psi.h)*s.h + gamma*i.h
  dih = beta*i.m*psi.h*s.h - (gamma + mu.h + alpha)*i.h
  dsm = mu.m*(s.m + i.m) - (mu.m + beta*i.h*psi.m)*s.m 
  dim = beta*i.h*psi.m*s.m - mu.m*i.m 
  
  return(list(c(dsh, dih, dsm, dim))); 
  
}

```


5. Call ODE solver _lsoda_ to integrate ODEs.


```{r}

odeoutput1 <- lsoda(Y0, timevec, odeequations, parms)

```


Anddddd that's it! We are done! We can now look at our shiny model outputs.


```{r}

head(odeoutput1)

```


The output dataframe consists of five columns, one for time, and the next four
represent the population size of each of our population classes at those time
points. The columns are organized in the same order we typed out our equations.
Therefore, column 1 represent susceptible hosts, column 2 infected hosts, etc.
To make our lives easier from now on, we'll go ahead and rename these columns.
We're also going to force the output into a data frame so that it is easier to
work with.


```{r}

colnames(odeoutput1)[2:5] <- c("S.h", "I.h", "S.m", "I.m")
odeoutput1 <- as.data.frame(odeoutput1)

```


We can inspect the dynamics of this system by ploting out these trajetories. 


```{r}

# Host

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=odeoutput1, aes(x=time, y=S.h), colour="black") +
  geom_line(data=odeoutput1, aes(x=time, y=I.h), colour="blue") +
  labs(y="Hosts") + 
  theme_classic()

# Vector

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=odeoutput1, aes(x=time, y=S.m), colour="black") +
  geom_line(data=odeoutput1, aes(x=time, y=I.m), colour="blue") +
  labs(y="Vectors") + 
  theme_classic()
  
```


Feel free to play with the parameter set, and investigate what happens to
disease dynamics as you do so. Is the system more _sensitive_ to some
parameters than others? What are some parameters we can change or add to
imitate various means of disease control? 


# Build-a-model workshop 2 -- Modelling forces of evolution 


In this section, we will switch gears 720$^\circ$, and work on a discrete time,
stochastic, evolution model! We will use an example of drug resistance
emergence to ask whether random events -- genetic drift -- can counteract the
effect of drug-resistance selection and block the evolution of this trait. 

You may recall from evolutionary biology class that the relative strengths of
drift vs. selection depend on population size and mutation rate. Here, we will
use simple population genetic simulations to disentangle these different
factors and get a better understanding of the role of these various forces of
evolution.

We will use the single-locus haploid model we were working on before as the
foundation of this model. Consider a population with $N$ individuals (of
parasites) each carrying a variant of this gene: _A_ is a drug-sensitive
allele, and _a_ confers resistance. We will impose mutation and selection on
this population at every time step, and at the end of each time step, we will
simulate genetic drift by random selecting a subset from the standing
population.  


## Model mechanics


### Mutation 

At each time step, some fraction of _a_ alleles will mutate to _A_ at rate $m$
and vice versa.

$$p_{t+1} = (1-m)p_t + m(1-p_t)$$

### Selection 

Recall this equation: 

$$p_{t+1}=\frac{W_A p_t}{W_A p_t+W_a (1-p_t)}$$

Recall also that selection acts on relative fitness, specifically, the
difference in relative fitness between _A_ and _a_. This is known as the
_selection coefficient_, and is commonly denoted $s$. The fitness of _A_ relative
to _a_ can be expressed simply as $\frac{W_A}{W_a}$. Taking $w_a$ as the
reference (i.e., setting $w_a$ to 1), we obtain the selection coefficient
against _A_ (i.e., assuming _A_ is at disadvantage) as follows: 

$$s=1-\frac{W_A}{W_a}$$

Through the magic of algebra, we can derive an expression for $p_{t+1}$
consisting only of terms related to our focal allele _A_:

$$p_{t+1}=\frac{p_t (1-s)}{p_t(1-s) + (1-p_t)}$$

### Genetic drift

We will simulate genetic drift by choosing a random sample from the population.
More specifically, we obtain $N_A$ by drawing $N$ individuals from a population
where a fraction $p$ of the population is _A_ using the function _rbinom_.
After this draw, we can retrieve $p$ from $N_A$ with $\frac{N_A}{N}$.

### Putting the model together

First, we'll set up parameters and initial conditions. We will initiate our
population with equal proportions of the _A_ and _a_ alleles, and we will
investigate a scenario where drugs don't exist (i.e., _A_ and _a_ perform
equally well).


```{r}

# Time
times <- 5000
timevec <- seq(1, times, 1)

# Parameters
N <- 10000 # Total population size (assume constant)
m <- 0.001 # Mutation rate
s <- 0 # Selection coefficient

# Intitial condition
p <- 0.5 # proportion of A allele

# Empty vector to store values of p over time
freq <- c()

```


Then, we will write a _for_ loop to help us impose the various forces of
evolution repeatedly through time.


```{r}

for(i in 1:times) { 
    
  # Mutation
    p <- (1-m)*p + m*(1-p)

    # Selection
    p <- ( p*(1-s) / (p*(1-s)+(1-p)) )
    
    # Drift 
    p <- ((rbinom(1,N,p)) / N)
    
    # Store values in vector
    freq[i] <- p
    
    }

```


That's it! We just made a stochastic population genetics model! 

Let's have a look at the results.


```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=timevec, y=freq)) +
  labs(x="time", y="p") + 
  theme_classic()

```


Here, we see that in the absence of selection, mutation and drift causes allele
frequency to fluctute randomly, but for the most part $p$ _seems to be_
hovering around its initial values of 0.5. 

Next, we can add in some drugs and see what happens to the fate of the
drug-sensitive _A_ alleles.

```{r}

# Update s 
s <- 0.005

# Don't forget to reset p and the storage vector 
p <- 0.5
freq <- c()

# Run loop again 

for(i in 1:times) { 
    
  # Mutation
    p <- (1-m)*p + m*(1-p)

    # Selection
    p <- ( p*(1-s) / (p*(1-s)+(1-p)) )
    
    # Drift 
    p <- ((rbinom(1,N,p)) / N)
    
    # Store values in vector
    freq[i] <- p
    
    }

# Make a plot of results

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=timevec, y=freq)) +
  labs(x="time", y="p") + 
  theme_classic()

```


Oh dear! It took no time for the resistant allele (_a_) to take over! The
population of the sensitive strain doesn't drop to zero, though, why is that?
And lastly, feel free to play around with this model to investigate the
relative effects of mutation, selection, drift, and how population size
mediates all of this!
