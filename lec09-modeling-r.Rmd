## Finding fixed points analytically 

Up until now we've been plotting `r eq_dn_dt` vs. $N$ to find the fixed points of a system. 
But we can also solve `r eq_dn_dt` $=0$ analytically to find the fixed points. One advantage of
finding the fixed points analytically is that you can see how the fixed points depend on the
model parameters, whereas before we had to choose parameters in order to plot `r eq_dn_dt`
and find the fixed points qualitatively.

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

First, we set `r eq_dn_dt` $=0$. 

$$0 = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

Next, we find all the values of $N$ that satisfy this equation. If either $rN = 0$ or 
$1-\frac{N}{K} = 0$, the equation is satisfied. This means we have two fixed points, 
one at $N = 0$ (since $r \neq 0$) and the other at $N = K$. These are the same fixed 
points we found graphically last week. Notice that one of the fixed points depends on 
$K$, but that neither of the fixed points depend on $r$. 

#### Challenge

Find the fixed point(s) of the following differential equation: 

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 1$$

   - First find the fixed points analytically on paper.
   - Plot $\frac{dx}{dt}$ vs. $x$ for $x$ ranging from $-2$ to $2$ in $0.1$ increments.
   - Sketch a phase portrait. Are the fixed point(s) stable or unstable?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

# fixed points are x = 1, x = -1

library(ggplot2)

x_seq <- seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1)

dx_dt <- x_seq^2 - 1

qplot(x_seq, dx_dt) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0))
```

## Fixed points in two-dimensional systems

Why are we bothering to find fixed points analytically when we could find them graphically? 
One reason that we touched on last class is that it allows us to see how the fixed points depend
on the model parameters. Another reason is that by solving the system analytically, we can be sure
that we found *all* the fixed points, even ones that we wouldn't find by simulating trajectories. 

Finding fixed points in two dimensions is similar to finding them in one dimension, but now
we have two equations that we have to solve *simultaneously*. That means we set both $dx/dt = 0$
and $dy/dt = 0$ and find combinations of $x$ and $y$ that make both zero at the same time. 

Let's find the fixed points for our predator-prey model:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = cx - yd$$

We need to solve $0 = ax - bxy$ and $0 = cx - yd$. We have two equations and two unknowns,
$x$ and $y$. Let's factor the equations where we can:

$$0 = x(a-by)$$

$$0 = cx - dy$$

One possibility from the first equation is $x = 0$. If $x = 0$, then $y$ must also be $0$
in order for $cx - dy = -dy = 0$. So one fixed point is $x = 0, y = 0$. 

The other factor in the first equation gives $a = by$, so $y = a/b$. If we plug $y = a/b$
into the second equation, we get $cx = ad/b$, so $x = \frac{ad}{bc}$. The second fixed point
is $x = \frac{ad}{bc}, y = \frac{a}{b}$.

Let's create a phase portrait using `phaseR` and add these fixed points to the phase portrait. 

#### Challenge

Define a function called `predator_prey` that uses the format required by `ode` to calculate 
and return $dx/dt$ and $dy/dt$. Feel free to refer to the notes from last class and re-use
what you need.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Challenge solution - basically copy and paste from lecture 8

predator_prey <- function(t, y, parameters) {
  # calculates dx/dt and dy/dt for a predator-prey model
  
  # t: time at which to evaluate derivatives
  # y: vector of system variables (c(X, Y))
  # parameters: vector of model parameters (c(a, b, c, d))
  
  # the arguments need to be named "t", "y", and "parameters", otherwise this won't work with phaseR, a package we will use later
    
  #now the state vector y has two elements because we have two species
  X <- y[1] # prey
  Y <- y[2] # predators
  
  a <- parameters['a']
  b <- parameters['b']
  c <- parameters['c']
  d <- parameters['d']
    
  # calculate rate of change
  dx <- a * X - b * Y * X
  dy <- c * X - d * Y
  
  # return rate of change
  return(list(c(dx, dy)))
}
```

Now we create the phase portrait using `phaseR`, add some trajectories, and add the fixed points.

```{r}
library(phaseR)

# parameters
a <- 5
b <- 1
c <- 1
d <- 0.2

params <- c(a = a, b = b, c = c, d = d) # so that they can be called by name

initial_conditions <-  matrix(c(1, 1, 
                                8, 5, 
                                2, 0, 
                                0, 8), 
                              ncol = 2,
                              byrow = TRUE)

# plot vector field: on a grid of points, plot an arrow in the direction of dx/dt and dy/dt
pp_flowField <- flowField(predator_prey, x.lim = c(0,10), y.lim = c(0,10),
                          parameters = params,
                          points = 15, # this is the density of grid points on which to plot arrows
                          system = 'two.dim', # 'two.dim' is default
                          add = FALSE)

# add trajectories
pp_trajectory <- trajectory(predator_prey, 
                            # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
                            y0 = initial_conditions, 
                            t.end = 30, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories
                            parameters = params, system = "two.dim")

# plot fixed points (using the base plotting system, which is not as good as ggplot)

# x = 0, y = 0 
points(0, 0, # x, y coordinates of point to plot
       cex = 1.5) # 'cex' stands for 'character expansion': marker size relative to default

# x = ad/bc, y = a/b 
x_star <- a * d / (b * c)  # fixed points are often denoted with `star` i.e. x*, y*
y_star <- a / b
points(x_star, y_star, # x, y coordinates of point to plot
       pch = 21, # pch = 21 gives a filled circle, 'pch' stands for 'plotting character'
       # see  https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/points.html
       bg = 'black', # background colour
       cex = 1.5) 
```

One interesting thing about this system is that $x = 0, y = 0$ is an unstable fixed point, but
there is one direction in which trajectories are attracted to it: along the y-axis. This makes
sense: if there are no prey ($x = 0$), then the predators must also go extinct. We will come
back to this later when we talk about analyzing stability analytically.

## Nullclines in two-dimensional systems

A nullcline is a curve on which one of the derivatives in the model is $0$. In other words, 
it's a series of points for which one of the variables is not changing --- its rate of change
is $0$ on that line. 

Finding nullclines is similar to finding fixed points, except that when we found fixed points,
we required both derivatives to be *simultaneously* zero. For nullclines, we only set one
derivative to zero at a time, and the other one is free to do what it wants. 

To find the $x$ nullcline(s), the curve(s) on which $x$ will not change, we set 
$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy$ to zero, ignoring $\frac{dy}{dt}$. 

$$0 = ax - bxy$$

Now we proceed exactly as if we were finding the fixed points, but we don't require that $y$
be anything in particular. We can factor the right hand side to $x(a-by)$, which means there
are actually two curves for which the rate of change of $x$ is $0$. One of them is at $x = 0$:
it's a straight line on the y-axis. For any value of $y$, provided $x = 0$, $x$ won't change.
The other one is at $y = a/b$: another straight line, this time at a fixed value of $y$.
For any value of $x$, provided $y = a/b$, $x$ won't change. 

Let's run a numerical solution for the predator-prey model we've been using and plot the null
clines we just found.

```{r}
# run the numerical solution
library(deSolve)

parameters <- c(a = 5, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0.2) 
state <- c(X = 2, Y = 2)
times <- seq(0, 50, by = 0.01)

result <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = predator_prey, parms = parameters)
result <- data.frame(result)

```

Plot a trajectory in the phase plane and the nullclines:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

x_seq <- seq(0, 8, by = 0.1)
y_seq <- seq(0, 8, by = 0.1)

df <- data.frame(x_seq, y_seq)

p1 <- ggplot() + # assign plot to a variable so we can use it later
  geom_path(aes(x = X, y = Y, color = time), result) + # trajectory
  geom_line(aes(x = 0, y = y_seq), df, color = 'dark red') + # x nullcline 1
  geom_line(aes(x = x_seq, y = a/b), df, color = 'dark red') # x nullcline 2

p1
```

The nullclines go through the places where the trajectory turns back on itself -- they go through
the 'peaks' and 'valleys' of $x$. 

Another way to think of the nullclines is as if we were back to a 1D system and were 
plotting $dx/dt$ vs. $x$ for a series of values of $y$. The nullcline passes through all
the points where $dx/dt = 0$. 

Now let's find the nullclines for $y$ by solving $0 = cx - dy$. In general, we want an equation in the
form $y(x)$, $y$ as a function of $x$, so that we can more easily plot it on our phase portrait axes. 

After rearranging, we find the solution to this equation: $y = \frac{c}{d}x$. Let's add it to the plot

```{r}
p1 +
  geom_line(aes(x = x_seq, y = x_seq*c/d), df, colour = 'blue') +
  xlim(0, 8) +
  ylim(0, 8)
```

The intersection(s) of the $x$ and $y$ nullclines are the fixed points, so plotting null
clines is also a way to graphically find the fixed points. This is particularly useful if 
it's hard to solve for the fixed points analytically. 

The `phaseR` package also includes a `nullclines` function to draw nullclines for you.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?nullclines
```

```{r}
# plot vector field: on a grid of points, plot an arrow in the direction of dx/dt and dy/dt
pp_flowField <- flowField(predator_prey, x.lim = c(0,10), y.lim = c(0,10),
                          parameters = params,
                          points = 15, # this is the density of grid points on which to plot arrows
                          system = 'two.dim', # 'two.dim' is default
                          add = FALSE)

# add trajectories
pp_trajectory <- trajectory(predator_prey, 
                            # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
                            y0 = initial_conditions, 
                            t.end = 30, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories
                            parameters = params, system = "two.dim")

pp_nullclines <- nullclines(predator_prey, 
           x.lim = c(0, 10), # axis limits
           y.lim = c(0, 10),
           # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
           y0 = initial_conditions, 
           t.end = 30, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories 
           parameters = params, system = "two.dim")
```

The vector field tells us graphically that there is one stable fixed point at ($x = 1, y = 5$) and 
one unstable fixed point at ($x = 0, y = 0$).

#### Challenge (to think about)

Is there a minimum number of nullclines a system must have? Are the nullclines
guaranteed to intersect? Are nullclines always straight lines?  

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Consider $dx/dt = 3$. Maybe this isn't truly a differential equation, but $dx/dt$ can never be 0.

# If each differential equation depends on at least one of the system variables 
# (and the equations are different), there will always be at minimum two nullclines. 

# The nullclines are not guarranteed to intersect: it's possible to not have a fixed point. 
# Example: dx/dt = y, dy/dt = y + 2

```

#### Challenge

Find the fixed point(s) and nullclines analytically for the following two-dimensional 
system. Verify your work by plotting the nullclines. 

## Quantitative stability analysis

We've now found fixed points analytically, but up until now we've been analyzing the stability 
of the fixed points by constructing a phase portrait and looking at it. This is a perfectly good
way to analyze stability, but we can do more: we can find out a whole lot with the quantitative
stability analysis we're about to do:

- Whether a fixed point will be stable or unstable
- How the system will behave near a fixed point (are there oscillations, etc.)
- How the stability and type of a fixed point depend on the model parameters
    
The last reason in the list is in many ways the best reason. As we will see, in some models the
number and/or stability of the fixed points depends on the system parameters, and quantitatively
analyzing stability will show us this.

To analyze stability, we **linearize** our model: we assume the system is linear close to the fixed
point so that we have differential equations in the form $d\vec{x}/dt \propto \vec{x}$, where 
$\vec{x}$ is a vector of length $D$, the number of dimensions in the model. Each element of $\vec{x}$
is a particular direction in phase space. In one dimension it's the same as the model variable, 
but in more than one dimension the directions don't necessarily have to be the same as the model
variables. Because the equations are in this linearized form, their solutions are exponential 
functions. These solutions will tell us how the system behaves in the region close to the fixed 
points. 

That was a lot. Let's start looking at examples. 

### Quantitative stability analysis in one dimension

Let's look at the logistic equation. 

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN (1-\frac{N}{K})$$

Let's call the right-hand side of this equation $f(N)$: $f(N) = rN(1 - \frac{N}{K})$. First, we find the fixed points by setting $f(N) = 0$. The fixed points are $N = 0$ and $N = K$.

Next, to linearize this equation, we take the **derivative** of $f(N)$ with respect to $N$: we calculate $\frac{\partial f(N)}{\partial N}$. 

$$f(N) = rN(1 - \frac{N}{K}) = rN - \frac{rN^2}{K}$$

In the second form it's a bit easier to take the derivative with respect to $N$.

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial N} f(N) = r - \frac{2rN}{K}$$

*Note*: the symbol $\partial$ stands for 'partial derivative': it means that we only worry about terms that **explicitly** depend on $N$ in this case. 

#### Challenge

Evaluate the following derivatives:

$$\frac{d}{dx} x^2$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial N} \text{e}^N$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{y}{x}$$

Now comes the magic. We evaluate the derivative we just calculated, $\frac{\partial f(N)}{\partial N}$,
at each of the fixed points in turn. If it's **negative**, the fixed point is **stable**. If it's
**positive**, the fixed point is **unstable**. That's all there is to it!

For the fixed point $N = 0$: 

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial N} f(N) \vert_{N=0} = (r - \frac{2rN}{K})\vert_{N=0} = r$$

$r$ is the growth rate, a number we haven't chosen, but we do know that it's always positive. 
That means $N = 0$ is an unstable fixed point. 

For the fixed point $N = K$: 

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial N} f(N) \vert_{N=K} = (r - \frac{2rN}{K})\vert_{N=K} = r - \frac{2rK}{K} = -r$$

If $r$ is positive, then this expression is negative, and $N=K$ is a stable fixed point.
Notice that if we happened to make the parameter $r$ negative, the stability of the fixed points 
would switch! These kinds of observations are much easier to make after we've quantitatively analyzed
stability.

Here's another way to think about what just happened. When we were drawing phase portraits, we looked at
the sign of $\frac{dN}{dt}$ and drew arrows to the left or right depending on its sign. Now, by looking
at $\frac{\partial}{\partial N} \frac{dN}{dt}$ instead, we're formally calculating the *slope* of
$\frac{dN}{dt}$ with respect to $N$ near the fixed point: where the slope is negative, we know that 
$N$ will be drawn back towards the fixed point, and where the slope is positive, $N$ will be pushed 
away from the fixed point. 

Let's revisit the differential equation $\frac{dx}{dt} = \text{sin}(x)$ to explore this idea.

```{r}
x_seq <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)

qplot(x_seq, sin(x_seq)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

The four fixed points visible here are respectively unstable, stable, unstable, and stable, because the slope through the fixed points is respectively positive, negative, positive, and negative.

### Stability analysis in two dimensions

Analyzing stability in two dimensions follows exactly the same principle, but the math is a little bit 
more complicated. Now instead of needing to find the slope in just one dimension, we have a
two-dimensional surface we need to consider. 

Imagine the landscape of $dx/dt$ and $dy/dt$ as an actual landscape with hills and valleys. 
We could have mountain peaks that represent unstable fixed points:

![Mt Rundle, Alberta](https://chrismartinphotography.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/mount-rundle-moonrise-c2a9-christopher-martin-95461.jpg)

We could have beautiful valleys that represent stable fixed points:

![Evergreen Brickworks](https://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Parks%20Forestry%20&%20Recreation/Events/images/brickworks-park-headerimages.jpg)

We could have a treacherous mountain pass:

![Abra Malaga Pass, Peru](https://d36tnp772eyphs.cloudfront.net/blogs/1/2015/06/4a.Peru-Abra-Malaga2.jpg)

Here's an idealized representation of a mountain pass. 

![Idealized mountain pass, By Paulba Legend (talk), CC BY-SA 3.0](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Saddleroute3.JPG)

#### Challenge

Is the high point of a mountain pass a **stable** fixed point or an **unstable** fixed point? Why?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

# a fixed point like a mountain pass is called a 'saddle point', and it's unstable. 
# It has one stable direction (from the peak down into the pass) and one unstable direction (down from the pass)
```

### Calculating the Jacobian matrix

We will now learn how to formally describe the stability of fixed points in two-dimensional systems --- 
how to quantitatively distinguish all the possible landscape shapes that can surround a fixed point.

Just like in the one-dimensional case, we want to calculate the slope of the two-dimensional surface 
in the vicinity of the fixed point. To do this, we calculate four partial derivatives and arrange them
into a matrix called the **Jacobian**.

Let's use our predator-prey model as an example. We let the right-hand side of each equation 
equal $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ respectively.

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy = f(x,y)$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = cx - dy = g(x,y)$$

This is the Jacobian matrix. It's often called $J$.

$$J=\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}$$

*Note*: it doesn't matter which variable is which, or which equation is called $f$ or $g$, as 
long as the order is consistent --- one function on the top row, the other on the bottom, one 
variable in the first column, the other in the second.

Let's evaluate each of these partial derivatives.

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (ax-bxy) = a - by$$

Think of the partial derivative as a slice in a particular direction through a potato: you could
look at how the potato shape changes along its long direction or its short direction, and by doing 
a partial derivative you are slicing along only one of the directions. 

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial }{\partial y} (ax-bxy) = - bx$$
$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (cx-dy) = c$$

$$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (cx-dy) = -d$$

We can put all these terms into the Jacobian. This matrix is now the Jacobian corresponding
to our predator-prey model.

$$J=\begin{bmatrix}
    a - by & -bx \\
    c & -d
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Classifying fixed points using eigenvalues of the Jacobian

From here, we need to calculate the **eigenvalues** of the Jacobian matrix. The eigenvalues of a
square matrix $A$ are numbers (often denoted $\lambda$) that satisfy the following relationship,
where $\vec{v}$ is a vector whose length is the dimension of $A$. (If $A$ is a 2-by-2 matrix, 
$\vec{v}$ is a length-2 vector.) 

$$A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$$.

What this means is that if the matrix $A$ is multiplied with a particular vector $\vec{v}$,
the resulting vector is a number multiplied by the original vector. 

This isn't true for just any vector. The particualr vectors that satisfy this relationship for 
the matrix $A$ are called **eigenvectors**. In general, this is how matrix multiplication works:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha & \beta \\
    \gamma & \delta
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha v_1 + \beta v_2 \\
\gamma v_1 + \delta v_2
\end{bmatrix}$$

The result is a new vector, still of length 2, but not necessarily a constant multiplied by 
the original vector $(v_1, v_2)$. 

For a 2-by-2 matrix, there are in general two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors. In the language of
stability, the eigenvectors are 'directions' in the landscape --- each one is an axis, like $x$ 
and $y$ are axes, except that the eigenvector directions don't have to be perpendicular or oriented
the same way as $x$ and $y$. 

The eigenvalues relate to stability because they determine how the system behaves along each eigenvector
direction. By writing our linearized system in the form $A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$, we have something
that looks like the differential equation $dx/dt = \lambda x$, which has an exponential function
$\text{e}^{\lambda x}$ as its solution. The eigenvalues $\lambda$ determine if the solution grows or
shrinks: if $\lambda >0$, the solution will grow, moving away from the fixed point. If $\lambda < 0,
the solution will shrink, moving towards the fixed point.

Our challenge is to find the eigenvalues of the Jacobian. We could also find the corresponding
eigenvectors, but we don't need to for stability analysis.

There is a formula to calculate eigenvalues: solve the equation $\text{Det}(A - \lambda \mathbb{1}) = 0$).
$\text{Det}$ stands for 'determinant', and $\mathbb{1}$ is the **identity matrix**: a matrix of the same
shape as $A$ but with $1$s on the diagonal and $0$s everywhere else.

However, we won't calculate eigenvalues by hand. R has a function called `eigen` that we can use to
directly calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix. 

We need to calculate eigenvalues separately for each fixed point, since each fixed point has its own
stability to be analyzed and will have its own eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 

```{r}
# stability analysis for predator-prey model

# choose parameter values
a <- 5
b <- 1
c <- 1
d <- 0.2

# start with a fixed point to look at
y <- 0
x <- 0

# define the partial derivatives
dx_dx <- a - b * y
dx_dy <- -b * x
dy_dx <- c
dy_dy <- -d

# create the Jacobian matrix
J1 <-
matrix(c(dx_dx, dx_dy, 
         dy_dx, dy_dy),
       nrow = 2,
       ncol = 2,
       byrow = TRUE
)

# calculate eigenvalues
e_vals1 <- eigen(J1)$values

print(e_vals1)
```

There are two eigenvalues because our system is two-dimensional. What do they mean? For a set of eigenvalues ($\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, etc.):

 - If the real part of $\lambda < 0$, that eigendirection is **stable**.
 - If the real part of $\lambda > 0$, that eigendirection is **unstable**.
 - If all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the fixed point is **stable**.
 - If one or more eigenvalues has a positive real part, the fixed point is **unstable**.
 - If the eigenvalues have an imaginary (**complex**) part, the fixed point is **oscillatory**.

Let's do the other fixed point:

```{r}
# stability analysis for predator-prey model

# choose parameter values
a <- 5
b <- 1
c <- 1
d <- 0.2

# the other fixed point
y <- a / b
x <- d * a / (b * c)

# define the partial derivatives
dx_dx <- a - b * y
dx_dy <- -b * x
dy_dx <- c
dy_dy <- -d

# create the Jacobian matrix
J2 <-
matrix(
c(dx_dx, dx_dy, 
  dy_dx, dy_dy),
nrow = 2,
ncol = 2,
byrow = TRUE
)

# calculate eigenvalues
e_vals2 <- eigen(J2)$values

print(e_vals2)
```

Let's return to our phase portrait and look at what the eigenvalues and eigenvectors have to do with 
the fixed points graphically. We can get the eigenvectors for plotting using the same function `eigen`
but pulling out the `vectors` part instead of `values`. 

```{r}
# calculate eigenvectors
e_vectors1 <- eigen(J1)$vectors
e_vectors2 <- eigen(J2)$vectors
```

The eigenvectors are plotted as thick dashed lines. In each of these directions, the system will evolve
approximately according to our linearized result: as an exponential function with parameter $\lambda$.
When $\lambda$ is complex, this means the system will oscillate.

```{r}
par(pty='s')

# plot vector field: on a grid of points, plot an arrow in the direction of dx/dt and dy/dt
pp_flowField <- flowField(predator_prey, x.lim = c(0,10), y.lim = c(0,10),
                          parameters = params,
                          points = 15, # this is the density of grid points on which to plot arrows
                          system = 'two.dim', # 'two.dim' is default
                          add = FALSE)

# add trajectories
pp_trajectory <- trajectory(predator_prey, 
                            # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
                            y0 = matrix(c(8, 5,
                                          1, 1),
                                        ncol = 2,
                                        byrow = TRUE), 
                            t.end = 30, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories
                            parameters = params, system = "two.dim")

pp_nullclines <- nullclines(predator_prey, 
           x.lim = c(0, 10), # axis limits
           y.lim = c(0, 10),
           # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
           y0 = initial_conditions, 
           t.end = 30, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories 
           parameters = params, system = "two.dim")

# plot the eigenvectors for fixed point (x = 0, y = 0)

# eigenvector for eigenvalue lambda = 5
lines(x = c(0, e_vectors1[1]), y = c(0, e_vectors1[2]), lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = 'green')

# eigenvector for eigenvalue lambda = -0.2
lines(x = c(0, e_vectors1[3]), y = c(0, e_vectors1[4]), lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = 'purple')

# plot the eigenvectors for fixed point (x = ad/bc, y = a/b)
