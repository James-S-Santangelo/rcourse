This course covers statistics and data analysis for ecology and reproducible quantitative methods in R. Statistical analysis, modelling, simulation, and data analysis are essential skills for applying ecology concepts to data. This course is designed to meet a growing demand for reproducible, openly accessible, analytically thorough, and well documented science. Students will learn to develop ecological population models, analyze data, and document their research using the R programming language. No prerequisite programming experience is required.

Prerequisites: BIO220H1 and one of EEB225H1, STA288H1, or STA220H1

## Improving your writing skills
Effective communication is crucial in science. The [University of Toronto provides services](http://writing.utoronto.ca/) to help you improve your writing, from general advices on effective writing to writing centers and writing courses. The Faculty of Arts & Science also offers an English Language Learning (ELL) program, which provides free individualized instruction in English skills. Take advantage of these!

## Academic integrity
You should be aware of the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. Also see [How Not to Plagiarize](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/). Note that it is NOT appropriate to use large sections from internet sources, and inserting a few words here and there does not make it an original piece of writing. Be careful in using internet sources â€“ there is no review of most online material and there are many errors out there. Use only academic or government internet sources when absolutely necessary. Make sure you read material from many sources (published, peer-reviewed, trusted internet sources) and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructor. Please make sure that what you submit for the final project does not overlap with what you submit for other classes, such as the 4th year research project. We will not enforce this, but the department will.

There are 100 marks in total. Your final course mark will be the sum of your assignment scores, which will be translated to a letter grade according to the [official grading scale](http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/teacher-info/academic-handbook-for-instructors/sections-9-11#official) of the Faculty of Arts and Science.

Students can be absent from two lectures (*including* project work days) without losing any participation marks. After that, students will lose 1 mark per missed lecture.

Assignments will be distributed and submitted in the R Markdown format via Quercus. Assignments will be handed out on Thursdays and are due 11:59 pm on the Tuesday eight weekdays later. _There will be a penalty of 5% per day (including week-ends) for late submissions._


### Final project grading rubric

|------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Contribution to group work | Student contributed little to project; self-assessed contributions are low in quality and/or quantity; self-assessment is not consistent with actual contribution.                                            | Student contributed adequately to project; made some significant contributions                                                                                    | Student substantially contributed to project to ensure success; self-assessed contributions are crucial to project; self-assessment is consistent with actual contribution. |
| Content                                        | Missing crucial information; methods and results are inconsistent, not logical, or not adequately explained; conclusions are confusing or unsupported by results; unnecessary information included as clutter | Most essential information included; methods and results are adequately described; conclusions supported by results; most included material is relevant to report | All essential information included; methods and results are succinct, clear, logical, and scientifically valid; conclusions are creative and meaningful; project is concise throughout |
| Style and reproducibility                      | Code and writing are poorly organized, poorly formatted, missing units, difficult to read, poorly documented, difficult to reproduce analyses                                                                 | Code and writing are well-organized, well-formatted, consistent use of units and significant figures                                                              | Code and writing are precise and clear throughout, free of errors, well-organized, well-documented, easily reproducible analyses, publication-ready                                    |
| Presentation                      | Presentation is poorly organized; much too long or much too short; presentation is unclear; presentation is missing information; presentation is not scientific and professional; presentation uses too much jargon; not all team members participate; does not adequately address audience questions            | Presentation is adequately organized; timing is appropriate; most information is presented logically; presentation is scientific and professional; most jargon is avoided; all team members participate but equally; audience questions are sometimes addressed well | Presentation is clearly and logically organized; presentation flows and is easy to follow; presentation includes appropriate information without jargon; presentation is well-rehearsed and high-quality; all team members participate equally; audience questions are clearly addressed |

As the final project is a team effort, all members within a group will receive the same mark. A final project that is considered to lie between two of the defined levels will be marked accordingly, e.g. between "Adequate" and "Excellent" would be 5, 6, or 7 marks.
