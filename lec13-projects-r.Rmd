## Git

### A short introduction

![[PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1531) on filenaming](image/comic-filenaming.gif)

The comic above is teasing about prematurely naming your thesis "FINAL", but it
also highlights a common method that many people use to keep track of different
versions of their files. This method involves making a copy of a file, naming it
differently from the original, and editing the contents of that new file,
repeated as many times as to get the document finished. This is the basic
concept of "version control", though quite primitive. More formal and structured
methods of version control keep track of what exactly changed, when, and by
whom (like how Google Docs). Git is one such system of version control. Git is
specially powerful when your project involves more than just a single file or
has any type of code or data involved.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a software that keeps detailed tracking
of your files and folders, keeping a history of exact characters that have been
changed. It's very powerful, open source, and is very popular among software
developers, programmers, R coders, and scientists. This is one of the main
reasons why we will be learning Git, because it has this massive online
community, support, and documentation. Git is especially powerful with
collaborating on more complex projects (such as a research project).

Git works by using several commands to track files ('add'), save ('commit') them
to history, check the 'status' of your folders and files (in a project/parent
folder, called a 'repo'), and see the history (the 'log') of what was saved. You
can do some much more advanced and powerful things in Git, but this lesson we'll 
focus on the basics (which you many only ever use).

#### Exercise

Follow the getting setup steps from command line:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email yourname@domain.com
```

Replace "Your Name", with, well, your first and last name. Replace the fake
email address with the email address you normally use.

Confirm it works by running:

```bash
git config --list
```

### The basic commands of Git

There are a few commands that you will use regularly when you start using Git.
In fact, you may never need to use more than this depending on what you do.

- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git log`
- `git status`

For your final assignment, you will be using a few more commands that we will
cover a bit in this lesson and much more next week.

- `git remote`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git checkout`
- `git branch` (maybe)

But first, let's focus on the first four basic commands.

- `git add` tells Git to start 'tracking' or watching the file(s) you point to
and put them into the 'staging area' (see the image below).
- `git commit` tells Git to take the changes made to the files you select and
save them into the history, moving files from the 'staging area' into the
history.
- `git log` shows you the history of your git repository (all the changes made
to the files; this is all contained in the `.git/` folder).
- `git status` gives you a brief overview of what is going on in your git
repository.

RStudio has an excellent Git interface, mainly for the basic things. However,
for slightly more complicated things you will need to use the terminal.
So we'll start by learning how to use
the terminal, then switch to using the RStudio interface.

#### Exercise

Create a new Markdown file called `bio.md` in the Git repo we created in class. Add your
name and one or two sentence blurb about yourself. *Using the command line*, add
this new file and commit to the history. Check the status and log.

### GitHub and your project

GitHub is a commercial, Git repository hosting service. For public repositories,
GitHub is free. (yeay open source!) GitHub is an extremely popular site for R packages,
with many of the most popular and powerful packages all on there (all of the
`tidyverse` packages are there, like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`). Your final
assignment is also on GitHub. When collaborating on GitHub, generally you'll
need to make a 'fork' of the original repository. In GitHub, a fork is a copy of
the original repo. While you could make edits to the files in the GitHub repo
using GitHub, its much faster to download ('clone') the repo onto your computer
to edit there. The image below shows the different repos and their interactions.
Because you are downloading ('cloning') your Forked GitHub repo, you need to
tell your computer where to look for the fork and original GitHub repo. That's what
the 'remote origin' (your fork) and 'remote upstream' (the original) mean. Git 
stores these links to the GitHub repos in these 'origin' and 'upstream' pointers.

```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph {

    node [shape = box, style = rounded]
    {
        rank = same;
        GitHubMain [label = 'Main GitHub\nrepo (UofTCoders)']
        GitHubFork [label = 'Forked GitHub\nrepo (yours)']
    }

    LocalRepo [label = 'Local repo']
    
    GitHubFork -> GitHubMain [label = 'Pull\nRequest']
    GitHubFork -> LocalRepo [label = 'remote origin']
    GitHubMain -> LocalRepo [label = 'remote upstream']
}
")
```

We'll all make a fork of the team final assignment. Then we'll use `git clone`
to download that repo onto your computer.

#### Exercise

Because we'll be using GitHub and the final assignment team repositories, you'll
need to add something to your Git settings. Add this `remote` (link) to
your Git repo of the final assignment:

```bash
# Change `teamname` to your team's name (JuniorCoders or Python)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/uoftcoders/eeb430.2017.teamname.git

# you should see two lines of text, one for origin (your GitHub fork) and one
# that you just added.
git remote -v
```

## File and folder structure

You'll notice in your final assignment folder that there are several files that
already exist. Many of these files are standard files that are included when you
make your own R package. The reason we are using it for this assignment is because
it provides an infrastructure to be able to build and create simple to complex
projects, in a way that is standardized and already well-documented. Here's a
description of each of the files/folders:

- `R/` folder will contain custom functions and other bits of R code that you'll
use for your final report in the `doc/` folder. Sometimes your code gets too 
complex and you need to break it down into multiple (or one) functions. Those
functions you will save in this folder.
- `data/` folder will contain any *small* to *medium* sized datasets you may use or
create. Most of the practice datasets are too massive to store on Git/GitHub, so
what you'll need to do is get everyone to have a copy of that dataset saved in the
`data/` folder but *don't* commit it to the Git history. This is also a great place
to save results output, since you probably don't want to run analyses on your massive
datasets every time to create your results.
- `doc/` contains all the R Markdown documents relevant to finishing your final report.
- `.Rbuildignore` is a specific file for when you want to load all the R files
in `R/`. We'll talk about this more as you do your final report.
- `.gitignore` is a special file used by Git to tell it to ignore certain files 
from tracking, such as files or figures that get generated from R code and data 
that you don't need to save.
- `DESCRIPTION` is a file that contains some metadata that is in the format 
used when making R packages. It contains information on who the authors are,
details about the project, what R packages you need to install for the project,
and more.
- `README.md` is, as the name says, a file to read. GitHub by default will show 
this file as the first file to view in a repo. The README contains important and
detailed information about the project.
- `*.Rproj` tells RStudio that this folder is a project. You open this when you 
work on your project.

### R projects and Git in RStudio

R projects are files that set a standard for how you and others use the files in
your repo, when they use RStudio. Opening this file opens RStudio with the options
and settings for your project.

Let's create a new R project called `testing`. We'll also create a Git repo in this
project. The nice thing about using this project style is that the Git interface is
quite nice. Create a new file called `bio2.md` and switch to the Git interface (either 
the Git tab or Git button at the top). You'll see that the common commands
(status, add, commit, log) are all there. Let's add and commit this new file.

#### Exercise

Add your name and a random string of text to the `bio2.md` file. View what
was changed on the RStudio Git interface. Add and commit that file. Then look in
History to see what you changed and what was changed in the file.

Now, add more lines of text and also delete some of the original text from the file.
Check out the Git interface and see what was changed. Add and commit. Check the history.

## Project work exercises

Open your final assignment `Rproj` files, so that RStudio opens in that folder.
Try to work through some of Assignment 7 (on the website), using RStudio and the
Git interface.
