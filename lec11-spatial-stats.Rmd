# Introduction

## Why do we care about space? 

Everything in ecology plays out in space. How heterogeneity in abiotic factors
across space drive ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) and
patterns (e.g., species distributions) has been of interest to ecologists for a
long time.

From an implicit perspective, the consideration of space is important to us all.
Whenever we have data collected across space, e.g., any sort of field survey,
the independence assumption is typically not valid, as sites closer in space
will tend to exhibit similar properties. This correlation in space can occur for
two reasons (not mutually exclusive):

1. Endogeneous mechanisms: processes inherent to the organism being considered,
such as low dispersal capacity or social behaviour (e.g., schooling and
herding). 
2. Exogeneous mechanisms: processes unrelated to the organism being
considered, such aggregation of resources or climate gradients.

Spatial autocorrelation may be classified as either positive or negative. A
positive correlation means similar values appear together, while a negative case
has dissimilar values appearing nearby.

Recall the mixed model lecture. When there is non-independence in regressions
that were not properly accounted for, we increase our Type I error (false
positive) rates, and risk inferring patterns that don't in fact exist. Checking
for spatial autocorrelation is therefore a crucial step in any regression
involving spatial data.


## Set up 

In this lecture, we will continue our quest into vector ecology, only this time
asking a much simpler question: what is the effect of mosquito abundance on
malaria prevalence? We will explicitly consider the role of space when we answer
this question.

Here are the packages we will be using today:


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(nlme)
library(sp)
library(ape)
library(rgdal) # R Geospatial Data Abstraction Library
library(raster)
library(maps)

```


And here is the data we will be working with:


```{r eval=FALSE}

download.file("https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/data/kenya.wide", 
              "kenya.wide")
download.file("https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/data/africa.wide", 
              "africa.wide")
download.file("https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/data/wc2.0_bio_10m_01", 
              "wc2.0_bio_2.5m_01.tif")
download.file("https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/data/wc2.0_bio_10m_12", 
              "wc2.0_bio_2.5m_12.tif")

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

kenya.wide <- read_csv("data/kenya.wide.csv")
africa.wide <- read_csv("data/africa.wide.csv")
temp <- raster::stack("data/wc2.0_bio_10m_01.tif") # Note special function for reading in raster files
rain <- raster::stack("data/wc2.0_bio_10m_12.tif")

```


The _kenya.wide_ data was introduced in the multivariate statistics lecture, and
we will revisit it briefly to illustrate working with spatial data at different
scales (regional vs. continental). The _africa.wide_ data was originally
obtained from the Malaria Atlas Project, an open-access, everything-malaria,
database created and maintained by an international consortium of Malaria
experts. In brief, data for global vector occurrence and malaria prevalence were
extracted, matched in space (within 1 km^2^ of each other) and time
(overlapped in study duration), and validated against original sources.
Additional data (e.g., climate, GDP, vector abundance) were sourced via diverse
means. For the purposes of this lecture, we will be focusing on a subset of
sites located in Africa.


# A _very_ brief introduction to spatial data


Spatial data can be broadly classified into two groups: vectors and rasters. 

Vectors are more "free-formed" in the information they store:

* Points -- a.k.a. vertices, a literal point position in space
* Lines -- connects vertices, such as a road or a river
* Polygon -- connects vertices into a closed area, such as a park perimeter or provincial boundaries

Rasters, a.k.a. grids, on the other hand, are much more rigid, as the name
suggests. This data type divide the landscape into identical and
regularly-spaced pixels, and stores values in each of these pixels. Rasters can
be fine or course, and doesn't have to be squares or rectangles. The pixels can
even be so fine that they are essentially a continuous scale, representing
gradual change.


## Coordinate reference systems (CRS)


The fundamental goal of encoding spatial data is to convey where the data was
collected. These are typically given as _coordinates_, as in the latitude and
longitude we are all familiar with. In reality, however, it is a lot more
complex to describe geographic locations. There are two broad classes of
coordinate systems:

1. Unprojected (aka geographic): Latitude and Longitude locations on the ellipsoid Earth
2. Projected: location on 2D representations of Earth (e.g., maps). 

_Projection_ refers to the process of projecting latitude and longitude from
Earth the earth's surface (which is a ellipse) onto a flat surface by some
standard formula known as a map projection. The main problem here is that it is
not possible to flatten a round object without distortion. This results in
trade-offs between area, direction, shape, and distance, because these features
cannot be simultaneously perserved when projecting from 3D to 2D. Unprojected
data is therefore always perferred, but alas, globes are inconvenient to use
(e.g., the distance described by one unit changes depending on where on earth
you are), so maps still predominate. There are many projections available --
there is no _best_ projection, but we can prioritize which features are
important to perserve in each case.

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection is commonly used in research
because it is more accurate at smaller scales, especially in distance
estimations. The UTM projection divides the Earth into 60 zones and uses a
different transverse Mercator projection in each zone to reduce distance
distortions. That said, one of the major disadvantage of UTM is that it is not
suitable for use over large areas.

For any projections, we need a model of the shape of the earth to work off of,
or, in geography lingo, a _datum_. The most commonly used datum is the World
Geodesic System 1984 (WGS84). There are, again, many datums available, including
a selection of local datum often does a better job at recording locations for
single country or region.

The most basic way to record spatial data is therefore a pair of coordinates and
the reference datum. More sophisticated means involve a complete coordinate
reference system a (CRS). CRSs are central to how software such as R and ArcGIS
read locations, however, it is not trivial to code a CRS as any number of
parameters (other than coordinates and datum) may be require to properly specify
a CRS. Thankfully, a lot of commonly used CRSs have been assigned simplied EPSG
(European Petroleum Survey Group) codes, which are unique IDs that identifies a
CRS. For example, the CRS for Kenya can be specified as either


```{r eval=FALSE} 

CRS("+init=epsg:32737")

``` 

OR

```{r eval=FALSE} 

CRS("+proj=utm +zone=37 +south +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")

```


Note that CRSs in R follow a very rigid format. Each piece of information (a
tag) is entered as a string, indicated by +, and each tag is separated by a
single space. Spacing within each tag is not allowed.


## Spatial data in practice 


The data we will be using today were not created as spatial objects, which means
they don't come with defined coordinate systems (in other words, R or ArcGIS
won't know that they refer to locations). The first thing we need to do is
therefore to assign a CRS.

_CAUTION_: only do this if you know what the CRS should be!

First, we need to make our numeric points into spatial points, and then
transform it from geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to map
projections for more accurate calculations later on. As a exmaple, we will use
the UTM projection for the Kenya data we previously worked with, because all of
those points fitted nicely into a single UTM zone.


```{r}

coord.kenya <- SpatialPoints(cbind(kenya.wide$long, kenya.wide$lat), 
                             proj4string=CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84"))

UTM.kenya <- spTransform(coord.kenya, 
                         CRS("+init=epsg:32737")) 
# EGSP:32737 for Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania 

```


For the Africa data, however, the UTM projection is no longer appropriate as the
data now span a much larger geographic area. We will be using the _sinusoidal_
projection instead. This is an equal-area projection and does a reasonable job
at perserving distance as well, especially well for locations near the equator,
so it appropriate for our case.


```{r}

coord.africa <- SpatialPoints(cbind(africa.wide$long, africa.wide$lat), 
                              proj4string=CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84"))

sinu.africa <- spTransform(coord.africa, 
                           CRS("+proj=sinu +ellps=WGS84")) 
# Note name of columns - x1 for latitude and x2 for longitude

```


We can now add our shiny new projected coordinates to main data file


```{r}

africa.wide <- bind_cols(africa.wide, as.data.frame(sinu.africa)) # Note order of rows!

```


We could further add environmental data from _rasters_ we pull from the
interwebs. Here, we extract annual temperature and annual rainfall for our sites
from a historic climate data repository, WorldClim2 (accessed Oct 2019). Again,
note the special function _stack()_ used to load raster files.


```{r eval=FALSE}

temp <- raster::stack("data/wc2.0_bio_10m_01.tif")
rain <- raster::stack("data/wc2.0_bio_10m_12.tif")

```


Let's have a look at these files. Simplest way is to do so is to plot them.


```{r}

plot(temp)
points(coord.africa)

plot(rain)
points(coord.africa)

```


We can extract data from raster files for our sites with a simple and
appropriately named function _extract_.


```{r}

extractions.t <- raster::extract(temp, coord.africa, df = TRUE, method="bilinear")
extractions.r <- raster::extract(rain, coord.africa, df = TRUE, method="bilinear")

```


The _df_ argument tells R to return a data frame. In case there is a missing
value in our raster file, _method="bilinear"_ will interpolate from the four
nearest raster cells.

Since the resulting object is a data frame, we can easily bind this new data to our main data file.


```{r}

# Change colnames

colnames(extractions.t)[2] <- "ann.temp"
colnames(extractions.r)[2] <- "ann.rain" 

extractions <- left_join(extractions.t, extractions.r, by = "ID")
africa.wide <- as.data.frame(cbind(africa.wide, extractions)) # Note order of rows!

```


_Sidebar_: WorldClim2 is a one-stop shop for a bunch of climate variables. There
are other open-source data repositories out there, such as WorldPop for
demographics, World Bank for economics data. There are lots of opportunities out
there for you to build custom datasets and ask lots of interesting questions.
For this lecture, however, we will focus on vector ecology, and therefore, not
consider these environmental variables further.


# A _very_ brief introduction to spatial statistics


In this section, we will learn the basics of spatial statistics, including how
to assess and correct for spatial autocorrelation in our analyses.

We'll assess for spatial autocorrelation with Moran's autocorrelation
coefficient, a.k.a Moran's I. To calculate Moran's I, we first need to create a
matrix of _inverse distance weights_, which describes how close together each
site is. It is very easy to do with three simple steps in base R (sorry, this is
just so much cleaner in base!).


```{r warning=FALSE}

# Generate distance matrix

dist.matrix <- as.matrix(dist(data.frame(sinu.africa)))

# Take reciprocal of each number

inv.dist <- 1/dist.matrix

# Replace diagonal with zeros

diag(inv.dist) <- 0

```


Inverse distance weights are now ready, and we can assess whether our variables of interest are correlated in space! We will be using the self-explanatory function Moran.I for this test. 


```{r}

Moran.I(africa.wide$PfPR, inv.dist, alternative="two.sided") 
# Two sided = both greater and less than

```


The null hypothesis is zero spatial autocorrelation present in the variable. A
significant p-value therefore means that sites that are closer together have
more similar prevalence in malaria. Let's repeat this analysis for our predictor
variable.


```{r eval=FALSE}

Moran.I(africa.wide$total.abundance, inv.dist, alternative="two.sided") 

```


Turns out, sites close to one another also have similar mosquito abundances.


## Visualizing spatial autocorrelation with semivariograms


Another way to explore spatial autocorrelation is to calculate semivariance.
Semivariance is a measure of the degree of similarity between pairs of points
separated by a specific distance. If the data are spatial autocorrelated, then
sampling units that are closer together in space might be expected to yield
similar responses and thus similar residuals. The _semivariogram_ (used
interchangebly with variogram) displays the variances within groups of
observations, plotted as a function of distance between the observations.

To make a semivariogram, first we fit a null model without any spatial
sturcture. We will be fitting this model with the function _gls()_ instead of
_lm()_ to facilitate future comparisons. These two differ in their method of
parameter estimation (ordinary least square vs. maximum likelihood) but
otherwise achieve the same thing.


```{r}

mod <- gls(log(PfPR)~log(total.abundance), data=africa.wide, method="ML") # ML for max likelihood

# plot(Variogram(mod, form = ~coords.x1+coords.x2, resType = "normalized"))

```


_Note_: This **V**ariogram() function comes from _nlme_ package, and should not
be confused with **v**ariogram() from package _gstat_. Although they perform the
same semivariance analysis, these functions take different arguments, so R will
get confused if we are not careful.

In spatially correlated data, semivariance typically increases with increasing
distance up to a point (the sill). The span of distances over which points are
correlated is called the range. In the above variogram, the range is
approximately "2e+06". The sinusoidal projection we used on our geographic data
presents distance in meters, therefore, we can conclude that sites within 200 km
of each other tend to have similar mosquito abundances. Note that semivariance
does not always plateau, but may exhibit forms of cycling. This can be
indicative of the underlying environment conditions (e.g., types of vegetation)
showing similar patterns across a landscape.


## Accounting for spatial autocorrelation in statistical models


There are -- you guessed it! -- many ways to incorporate spatial autocorrelation
structure into regression analyses. One of the most stragihtfoward ways to do so
is to think of it as a random effect. The _gls()_ function we used above allows
us to do just that. This method is simple and works really well if normality
assumptions are met.

There are -- you guessed it again! -- five autoregressive correlation structures
we can model. They all describe the degrading of correlation between samples as
you move away in space, with the different functional forms dictates the rate of
decay as you move away. These different functions are necessary because the
cause and consequences of spatial autocorrelation can differ across datasets.
For instance, the way that the sites are clustered (or not clustered) can have
an impact on how autocorrelation should be modelled. The five options are:

1. Exponential
2. Gaussian
3. Linear
4. Rational quadratic
5. Spherial

_Note:_ all of these assume _isotropy_, which means data are uniform (or
uniformly different) in all directions. We can imagine situations where that may
not be the case, for example, a river carrying substrate downstream, or when
wind consistently blow in one direction. We can actually check for those
assumptions with variograms, but that is beyond the scope of this lecture.

While sometimes you can tell from the variogram which structure is most
suitable, it is very common practice to fit all the alternative models and then
chose the one with the lowest AIC.

So here we go, the grand finale where we input the spatial structure into our model. 

```{r}

mod.exp <- gls(log(PfPR)~log(total.abundance), 
               data=africa.wide, 
               method="ML", 
               corr=corSpatial(form=~coords.x1+coords.x2, type ="exponential"))

```

Repeat that four more times, then inspect AIC scores.

```{r results="hide"}

mod.gau <- gls(log(PfPR)~log(total.abundance), data=africa.wide, method="ML", 
               corr=corSpatial(form=~coords.x1+coords.x2, type ="gaussian"))

mod.lin <- gls(log(PfPR)~log(total.abundance), data=africa.wide, method="ML", 
               corr=corSpatial(form=~coords.x1+coords.x2, type ="linear"))

mod.rat <- gls(log(PfPR)~log(total.abundance), data=africa.wide, method="ML", 
               corr=corSpatial(form=~coords.x1+coords.x2, type ="rational"))

mod.sp <- gls(log(PfPR)~log(total.abundance), data=africa.wide, method="ML", 
              corr=corSpatial(form=~coords.x1+coords.x2, type ="spherical"))

```

```{r}

AIC(mod, mod.exp, mod.gau, mod.lin, mod.rat, mod.sp)

```


Now, have a look at the model outputs with and without spatial structure:


```{r}

summary(mod)
summary(mod.exp)

```


Oh no! After accounting for spatial autocorrelation, the relationship between
total abundance and malaria prevalence went away! Now, that doesn't mean that
mosquito abundance doesn't have any effect on disease. This means that, across
such large spatial scale, other processes become more important in determining
malaria prevalence. The interpretation of these results are indeed the same as a
mixed model.


## Appendix: A _very very very_ brief intorduction to making maps with ggplot 

There are so many ways one can make maps in both base R and ggplot and beyond.
In this example, we will be making use of maps taken from the _maps_ package and
customizing them in ggplot. The issue with this pacakge is that you always have
to start with a world map and then subset by country. This means that when you
want to plot Africa, you have to sit there and subset all day.

There is a more _pure_ ggplot way of making maps, called _ggmap_. This package
extracts maps from Google maps, which is awesome because it gives you assess to
high quality maps from all over the world, and you can zoom in on whichever
region you want. However, you do have to register with Google to use it, and
Google asks for your credit card number when you register. So, not great.

We will therefore go with the free-all-the-way route, and use _maps_. Instead of
subseting the map officially, we'll cheat a little and just crop the graph to
show Africa. We'll also do an example of plotting a single country -- Kenya.

```{r}

map.world <- map_data("world") 

# Note: you must include group=group in aes() to ensure proper plotting

ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = map.world, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill=NA, colour="gray85") + 
  coord_fixed() + # Prevents map from being distorted 
  geom_point(data=africa.wide, aes(x=long, y=lat, colour=total.abundance)) +
  xlim(-20,60) + # Approximate longitudinal and latitudinal locations of Africa
  ylim(-40,40) + 
  theme_bw()

map.kenya <- map_data("world", region="kenya") 

ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data=map.kenya, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill=NA, colour="gray85") + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  geom_point(data=africa.wide[africa.wide$country=="Kenya", ], aes(x=long, y=lat, colour=total.abundance)) 

```
